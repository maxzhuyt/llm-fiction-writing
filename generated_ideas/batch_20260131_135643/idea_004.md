**Story Idea:**

A form of bureaucratic report—specifically, a facility inspection document with handwritten marginalia that grows increasingly frantic. A safety inspector visits a consortium of connected warehouses that process "temporary workers" (revealed slowly to be something not quite human), and his official checklist observations ("verify metallic residue in drainage," "traffic flow exceeds posted capacity") accumulate into horror as his penciled notes in the margins shift from professional skepticism to desperate prayer. The ending inverts when we realize the report is being read aloud by whatever runs the facility, deciding whether the inspector understood too much to leave—and his final marginal note, "Ricardo was right about Sundays," is a code meant for whoever finds his clipboard next.
