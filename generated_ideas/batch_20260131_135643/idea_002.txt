**Form: Annotated auction catalog with handwritten marginalia**

A recently widowed woman attends an estate sale to liquidate her late husband's hoarded collections, only to discover among the lots a pearl necklace she'd reported stolen twenty years ago—listed as property of a woman in Greenland she's never heard of. As she works backward through the catalog's provenance notes, she uncovers that her husband maintained a parallel domestic life for three decades, complete with a daughter now descending on the auction to claim her inheritance. The story unfolds through the official catalog descriptions, the widow's increasingly unhinged margin notes, and the legal correspondence that begins arriving mid-auction, each document revealing how thoroughly one person can wander through a double life while appearing geometrically precise to everyone watching.
