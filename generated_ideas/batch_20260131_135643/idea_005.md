**Story Idea:**

A Mazda assembly line worker in Indonesia discovers that her factory's rejected "cyst" parts—small defective engine components flagged for destruction—are being secretly diverted by her supervisor Bruno into an unauthorized export envelope destined for a Campo region militia. The story unfolds through her increasingly paranoid quality control reports, which she doctors to appear routine while embedding coded warnings she hopes someone in corporate will decode before the next shipment lands. The trajectory of her reports shifts from technical jargon to barely-concealed pleas as she realizes the backlog of flagged parts matches exactly the timing of news reports about vehicle bombs, and that her saved copies may be the only evidence—or her death warrant.

**Form:** Corporate quality control reports with handwritten marginalia, spanning eleven weeks.
