**Form: Fragmented field notes and personal marginalia found in a water-damaged research notebook**

A wildlife behaviorist studying lion pride dynamics in the western Serengeti becomes obsessed with a dethroned queen—an elderly female pushed to the pride's margins who should be dead within weeks but instead survives eighteen months through increasingly inexplicable means. The researcher's scientific objectivity erodes as she begins attributing intention, then strategy, then something like *memoria* to the lion's movements, her notes shifting from data to desperate interpretation as she realizes she's witnessing either an unprecedented case of adaptive behavior or projecting her own recent widowhood onto an animal. The tension builds through what's *absent* from the later entries—crossed-out sentences, pages torn away, a final note reading only "I was supposed to be observing."
