**Form: A series of increasingly frantic inventory logs from a hotel minibar restocking service**

A minibar attendant at a luxury hotel notices that Room 1408's chocolate and liquor supplies are being consumed at impossible rates—a quart of whiskey drained between her 2 PM and 2:15 PM checks, the room's occupant dead for three days according to the coroner. The logs begin as mundane corporate documentation but gradually reveal her attempts to rationalize the inexplicable, her decision to install a hidden camera, and what she sees drinking in the silence of that empty room. The final entry is written by her replacement, who notes only that the previous attendant quit without notice and that Room 1408's consumption levels have returned to normal—except the new guest insists she never touches chocolate.
