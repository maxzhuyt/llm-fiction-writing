**Story Idea:**

A wildlife biologist in a remote Canadian province discovers that the high-profile conservation revival she's been documenting—the return of wolves to their ancestral range—was secretly engineered by her estranged father, a disgraced geneticist who admits in a deathbed letter that the "wild" wolves are actually his intellectual property: patented chimeras designed to be dependent on a proprietary supplement only he can provide. The story unfolds through her field notes, increasingly frantic as she realizes the animals she's championed will die within months unless she accepts her father's proposal to continue his work—and his lies. What begins as a straightforward betrayal narrative becomes something stranger when she finds evidence suggesting the wolves themselves have begun adapting beyond his design, raising the question of whether she should expose the fraud and doom them, or protect a new form of wildness that was never supposed to exist.
