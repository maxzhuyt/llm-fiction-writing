**Story Idea:**

A newspaper columnist covering local politics discovers that her late father—memorialized as a civil rights hero—was actually a paid informant whose testimony destroyed innocent lives, when a disciplinary board's archived transcripts surface during a municipal building demolition. The story unfolds through her weekly column, which begins as an investigative piece about city corruption but gradually transforms into something far more personal as readers watch her publicly unravel the mythology of her own family in real-time. Each column entry is interspersed with the redacted transcripts themselves, and the barbed comments section responses from readers who knew her father—some defending him, others finally given voice to accuse—create a Greek chorus that determines whether she can survive publishing the final, most damning document: his handwritten list of names, with her mother's among them.
