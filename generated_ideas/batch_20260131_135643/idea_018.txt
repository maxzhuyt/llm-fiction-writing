**Form: Annotated maintenance log from a decommissioned lighthouse**

A lighthouse keeper on a remote Pacific station discovers that by adjusting the rotation speed and axis of the lamp mechanism in precise increments, she can make ships disappear—not sink, but vanish from reality entirely, leaving behind only vacant manifests in port records. The log begins as routine maintenance notes but gradually reveals her systematic experiments to understand the phenomenon, her growing horror at what she's accidentally done to three vessels, and her final attempt to rotate herself out of existence before the relief keeper arrives. The story's grip comes from the technical, almost bureaucratic tone slowly cracking as she cross-references her "corrections" with newspaper clippings about missing ships she's taped between entries—and the final annotation, in different handwriting, noting the lamp was found spinning at an impossible speed with no one present to have set it.
