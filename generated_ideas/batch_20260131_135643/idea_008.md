**Form: Annotated auction catalog from Christie's, with handwritten marginalia**

A recently deceased Greek shipping heiress left instructions that her estate sale catalog must include her own caustic commentary on each item—revealing that the Mesopotamian cylinder seal (Lot 47) was stolen by her prosecutor father from a Jewish family in 1942, that the Qing dynasty vase (Lot 112) is an expert forgery she commissioned to humiliate a rival collector, and that the anonymous bidder driving up prices on her late husband's portrait is almost certainly his secret first wife. The catalog annotations grow increasingly manic and confessional as lot numbers climb, until the final item—a safety deposit box key with no listed contents—includes only the instruction: "For the winning bidder who has read this far, and understood what I am actually selling."
