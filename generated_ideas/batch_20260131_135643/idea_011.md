**Story Idea:**

A retired air traffic controller, now seventy and in the early phase of dementia, begins receiving radio transmissions on her old aviation headset from a flight that disappeared over the Sierra Nevada in 1987—a flight she was working the night it vanished, and whose pilot she'd been secretly married to for three weeks. The transmissions seem to be coming from the moment before the crash, repeating on a loop, but each time she responds, small details change: the pilot mentions their wedding, then doesn't; he calls her by a nickname only she knew, then addresses her formally. The story takes the form of her notebook entries, where she's trying to document the transmissions as evidence before her memory becomes too unreliable—but her own notes begin contradicting each other, and she can't tell if she's finally learning what happened that night or if she's constructing an intricate fiction to fill the gaps her mind is creating.
