**Form:** Alumni magazine profile that gradually reveals itself to be an obituary

**Story Idea:** A prestigious university's alumni magazine runs what appears to be a celebratory profile of Carmen Voss, a beloved biology professor known for her groundbreaking seed conservation work, told through interviews with former students who each remember a different, increasingly contradictory version of her. As the testimonials accumulate, the reader realizes the profile is being assembled posthumously, and that Carmen has engineered her own disappearance into the high-altitude seed vault she helped design—the final interview revealing she discovered something in the genetic remainder of an ancient grain that made her incapable of returning to ordinary life. The magazine's editor intrudes with increasingly desperate footnotes trying to verify basic facts, exposing that no one can agree on whether Carmen is dead, missing, or simply done being counted among the living.
