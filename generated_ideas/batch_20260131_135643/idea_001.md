**Form: Procurement requisition forms with handwritten margin notes**

A supply officer at a remote Alaska radar station begins noticing impossible items appearing on approved procurement lists—requests she never submitted for equipment that doesn't exist, signed with her own signature. The margin notes, in handwriting that mirrors hers but isn't, contain increasingly specific details about her childhood that she's never told anyone. As she's detained for suspected espionage, she realizes the forms are dated three weeks in the future, and the next one requisitions a body bag with her measurements.
