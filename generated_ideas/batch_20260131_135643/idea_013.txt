**Form: Transcripts of mandatory therapy sessions, with handwritten margin notes from a federal reviewer**

A retired CIA officer, now 78 and in early-stage dementia, has been court-ordered to psychological evaluation after mailing a handgun to a sitting senator. Across six session transcripts, she reveals—in fragments that her therapist initially dismisses as confusion—her role in a 1962 operation that converted a Havana bowling alley into an assassination staging ground. The reviewer's increasingly urgent margin notes reveal they're not assessing her competency; they're determining whether her "confused" disclosures match classified files that were supposed to have been destroyed. The final transcript is missing, replaced by a single statutory notice of the patient's transfer to an unlisted federal medical facility.
