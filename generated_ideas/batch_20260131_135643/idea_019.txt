**Story Idea:**

A casino's head of security discovers that their high-stakes poker room has been infiltrated by a dying mathematician who isn't there to win money—she's using the games to secretly pass along fragments of a proof that would expose a massive financial fraud, encoded in her betting patterns. The story unfolds through the security team's incident reports, surveillance log timestamps, and inter-department memos as the protagonist slowly realizes he must choose between his job and helping her complete the transmission before her employer's "compensation specialists" arrive. What makes it impossible to put down: each memo reveals he's been watching the wrong threat, and the grinding institutional machinery he's faithfully documented is about to grind her up—unless his final report contains a strategic lie.
