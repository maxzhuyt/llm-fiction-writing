**Form: Handwritten ledger entries with marginalia, spanning three months**

A morbidly obese accountant at a 1952 import company discovers that the tariff discrepancies she's been instructed to ignore correspond exactly to the weights of missing persons reported in the newspaper—someone is shipping human cargo, and the arithmetic suggests her own brother Jerry, who vanished in Korea but whose "body" was supposedly repatriated, was 47 pounds too light. As she audits backwards through the books, her marginal calculations grow increasingly frantic, and she realizes the company's security chief has noticed her staying late. The ledger ends mid-entry, but a final page contains only a cigarette burn, a brown thumbprint, and a single word in unfamiliar handwriting: *Approved.*
