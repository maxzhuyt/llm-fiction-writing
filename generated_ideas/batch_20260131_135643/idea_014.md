**Form: Series of increasingly frantic internal memos from a Norwegian pharmaceutical company's PR department**

A mid-level communications officer discovers that the company's high-profile potassium supplement—marketed to elderly customers as "robust aging"—has been causing cardiac events that local coroners have been misclassifying as natural deaths, and she must decide whether to leak documents before the upcoming shareholder conference. The memos begin as vanilla corporate speak ("per our discussion regarding the Donna Halvorsen incident") but decompose into raw despair as she realizes her superiors already know and are calculating acceptable mortality coefficients. The story becomes impossible to put down because each memo reveals she's being watched, her emails are being monitored, and the final memo—dated three days before the documents went public—is addressed to her replacement and welcomes them to the position, with no explanation of her departure.
