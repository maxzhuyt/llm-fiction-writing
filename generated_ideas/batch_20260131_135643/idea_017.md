**Form: Interoffice memos and maintenance logs from a state capitol building**

A facilities manager notices that the building's ventilation system has been secretly modified to pipe air from the governor's office into a basement room that doesn't appear on any blueprint—and the longitudinal ductwork matches renovations ordered by three successive administrations across party lines. As she traces the unauthorized modifications through decades of work orders and requisition forms, she discovers the room contains recording equipment that has captured every private conversation in the executive suite since 1987, maintained by a rotating cast of janitors who each believed they worked alone for different masters. The story unfolds through her increasingly paranoid maintenance logs, the bland memos she uses to test who's watching her investigate, and the morning she arrives to find her own personnel file open on her desk with a single addition: her name on the janitor rotation schedule.
