**Story Idea:**

A satellite imaging analyst discovers that her elderly father's remote sheep farm in the Scottish Highlands has been systematically erased from every commercial mapping database over the past eighteen months—replaced with procedurally generated heather fields that don't exist. The story unfolds through her increasingly frantic attempts to document the discrepancy: screenshot comparisons, emails to tech support that go unanswered, and finally her father's handwritten letters describing strangers in unmarked vehicles who've been "coaching" him to sign documents he can't remember signing. The form alternates between her clinical incident reports filed with three-letter agencies and her father's deteriorating cursive, until the two narratives converge on what's actually buried beneath the farmhouse he inherited from a painter who worked for the Ministry of Defence in 1962.
