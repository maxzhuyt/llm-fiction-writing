**Form: Fragmented radio transcripts interspersed with handwritten margin notes from an archivist**

A indigenous Quechua community in the Peruvian highlands has maintained average lifespans of 140+ years for centuries, a secret fiercely guarded until a 1952 influenza outbreak forced them to request outside medical help—and a young Protestant missionary recorded everything on a portable wire recorder before the village elders realized what he was capturing. Seventy years later, an archivist at a failing religious radio station discovers the deteriorating recordings while cataloging materials for auction, and begins transcribing them just as representatives from the community arrive demanding their return. The transcripts reveal not a fountain of youth but something far stranger: a ritual "fold" in time that the community has been maintaining for four hundred years, and the missionary's recordings may have already damaged it beyond repair.
