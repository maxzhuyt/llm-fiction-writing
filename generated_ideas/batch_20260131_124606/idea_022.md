**Story Idea:**

A democracy watchdog organization receives an anonymous data dump tracking every US congressman's votes against their donors' interests over forty years—except the data comes from 2047, and includes votes that haven't happened yet. The story unfolds through the internal Slack channels, research memos, and increasingly paranoid email chains of the three junior analysts assigned to verify the leak, as they discover the "future" votes are beginning to match real-time congressional records with catastrophic accuracy. The final third reveals their investigation is itself part of the data dump, their conclusions already written, forcing them to decide whether to publish findings that might constitute the very manipulation they're exposing.
