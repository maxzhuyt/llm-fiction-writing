**Story Idea:**

A freight train conductor named Joel discovers that someone has been using the railroad's obscure punctuation-based signaling system to transmit coded messages between cities—messages that, once decoded, appear to be invalidating witness testimonies in a decades-old civil rights cold case from 1962. The story unfolds through his recovered field notebook, filled with hand-drawn signal diagrams, increasingly paranoid margin notes, and taped-in photographs of elderly men who keep appearing at rural crossings, watching. What begins as a railway enthusiast's puzzle becomes a downward spiral when Joel realizes the witnesses aren't being silenced—they're being *erased from records entirely*, and his own grandfather's name just appeared in the next transmission.
