**Story Idea:**

A traveling spice merchant in 1962 Algeria discovers that her late nurse mother had been running an underground network converting French colonial currency into untraceable gold for FLN fighters—and the ledger she's inherited contains one final, undelivered investment that three different factions are now killing to claim. The story unfolds through the mother's nursing logbook, where patient vitals and medication schedules encode drop locations and contact names, interspersed with the daughter's present-day margin annotations as she deciphers entries while fleeing across the desert toward the Tunisian border. What makes it impossible to put down: each decoded entry reveals her mother as someone increasingly unrecognizable, while the daughter must decide whether to complete a dead woman's mission or disappear with enough gold to split from her country forever.
