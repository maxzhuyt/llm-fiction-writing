**Form: Annotated legal brief with increasingly desperate marginalia**

A dying appellate judge must write the binding opinion on a case involving her estranged daughter—a beach town mayor accused of deliberately delaying flood barrier repairs to drive down property values for a development sale. The judge's pneumonia worsens as she discovers her daughter's actions, though legally criminal, saved a migrant worker camp that the "protected" luxury homes would have displaced. The story unfolds through her formal legal syntax slowly cracking in the margins, where she argues with herself about whether compassion can be categorically excluded from justice, her handwriting deteriorating across drafts until the final opinion becomes something neither law school nor her daughter would recognize.
