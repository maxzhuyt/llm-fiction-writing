**Form: Medical board disciplinary hearing transcript**

A thyroid specialist in Bangkok discovers that a high-end "wellness resort" catering to wealthy Norfolk retirees is actually harvesting patient tissue samples for a black-market organ compatibility database, and she must testify against her own mentor—the physician who saved her career after a malpractice stigma nearly destroyed her—while he sits across the hearing room, silently mouthing the names of her children. The transcript format allows readers to experience her careful, clinical answers while footnotes reveal her handwritten notes passed to her lawyer: increasingly frantic calculations about what he actually knows, what she can prove, and whether the sixty seconds of recess will be enough time to call home. The tension lies not in whether she'll tell the truth, but in watching her construct a version of truth that protects her family while still destroying him—and recognizing, through the gaps in her testimony, that she may have known about the database longer than she admits.
