**Story Idea:**

A city comptroller discovers that for forty years, her municipality has been depositing exactly $1 into a chamber account she's never seen before—deducted automatically from the civic budget under a line item marked only "HERN STREET COVENANT." When she traces the trail to a condemned building on a street that doesn't appear on any modern map, she finds 14,600 dollar bills pinned to the walls in crimson wax, each one annotated with the name of a citizen who died that year and a single word: "INSTEAD." The story unfolds through her audit report, which grows increasingly unhinged as she realizes the payments stopped three years ago—the same year the city's death rate tripled—and the account is now demanding back-payment with interest.

**Form:** Municipal audit report with handwritten marginalia deteriorating into desperate personal notes.
