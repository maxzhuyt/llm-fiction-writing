**Form: Series of increasingly erratic dashboard camera transcripts with timestamp gaps**

A long-haul trucker driving a minimalist lifestyle—no phone, no family, just the road—begins noticing that her cargo manifests don't match what she's actually carrying. The timestamps on her dashcam footage show gaps she can't account for, and the reflective highway signals she passes seem to blink in patterns that spell out coordinates. When she finally follows them to a desert grid of identical shipping containers, she finds other truckers already there, all with the same memory gaps, all converging on the same impossible conclusion: they've been unknowingly transporting pieces of something that's now assembling itself.
