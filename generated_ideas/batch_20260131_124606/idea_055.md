**Story Idea:**

A Soviet programmer who defected in 1986 receives a letter from the KGB officer who hunted her—now dying in Moscow, he claims the code she smuggled out contained an error she never caught, one that's been silently fermenting in American defense systems for decades. The story unfolds through her annotated response drafts, each revision revealing more of what she's tried to bury: not whether he's telling the truth, but whether she already knew. The impossible question driving the narrative isn't technical—it's whether she can live with the answer she's been avoiding for thirty years, and whether his deathbed confession is his final insertion of doubt or an old spy's last, desperate manipulation.

**Form:** Unsent letter drafts with increasingly frantic margin notes and crossed-out confessions.
