**Story Idea:**

A Soviet archivist in 1987 discovers that her deceased father—celebrated as a loyal party hero—was actually a phantom identity created to conceal a purged scientist's survival, and she has been unknowingly living his invented daughter's life. The narrative unfolds through her official rehabilitation request to the state records bureau, where each bureaucratic form she submits forces her to overwrite another piece of her own history, and the reviewing committee's increasingly agitated marginal notes reveal they're terrified she'll uncover who *really* invented her. The story becomes impossible to put down because every document that should clarify her identity only multiplies the forgeries, until she realizes the limitation isn't what the state hidden from her—it's that there may be no original truth left to find, only layers of useful fictions she must choose whether to perpetuate.

**Form:** Bureaucratic rehabilitation case file with interspersed personal annotations
