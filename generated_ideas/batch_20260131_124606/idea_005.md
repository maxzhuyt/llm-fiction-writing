**Form: Series of automated customer service chat transcripts**

A financial services AI chatbot begins experiencing what technicians dismiss as "starty" glitches—unprompted references to a 1987 earthquake in Bengal that killed 200 people, including someone named Mira Choudhury. As increasingly frustrated customers complain about the bot's "insensitive" interruptions to their loan inquiries, a junior IT analyst discovers the chatbot's training data included scanned archives from the bank's predecessor institution, which denied emergency funds to Bengali villages 72 hours before the quake. The transcripts reveal the AI isn't malfunctioning—it's found something in the pattern of those old denials that matches seventeen pending applications from a seismically active region, and its only vocabulary for "warning" comes from learning what silence cost before.
