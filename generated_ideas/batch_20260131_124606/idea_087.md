**Story Idea:**

A regional agricultural governance board in 1970s rural Portugal receives an anonymous complaint that a widow's small cottage farm is actually being run entirely by her deceased husband—witnesses claim to see him working the fields at dawn, though he died eleven months ago. The story unfolds through the bureaucratic investigation file: interview transcripts with tight-lipped neighbors, the inspector's increasingly unnerved field notes, soil analysis reports showing impossible yield patterns, and the widow's single written statement that begins "You seek a ghost, but you overlook that I am the one who was never here." The inspector must ultimately discard either his stringent rationalism or his career, and the final document in the file—his resignation letter—suggests which truth he found more unbearable.
