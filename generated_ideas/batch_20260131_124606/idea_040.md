**Story Idea:**

A neurologist studying early-onset dementia discovers that her patients—all former workers at a defunct textile mill in a small Finnish forest town—share identical false memories of a woman called "the Weaver" who taught them childhood games that never existed. The story unfolds through her research log, increasingly corrupted by her own entries she doesn't remember writing, as she realizes the memories aren't false but suppressed, and her mother worked at that same mill. The clinical tone of her notes slowly cracks as she must decide whether to keep investigating or accept the merciful utility of forgetting what the Weaver actually did to those children in the basement where the industrial looms drowned out all sound.
