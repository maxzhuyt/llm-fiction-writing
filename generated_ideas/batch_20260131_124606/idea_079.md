**Story Idea:**

A Lebanese chef who survived the Beirut port explosion now runs a tiny restaurant in rural Vermont, where a local mechanic becomes obsessed with understanding why certain dishes appear on the menu only on specific dates—eventually realizing each recipe corresponds to someone the chef lost, cooked on their death anniversary. The story unfolds through health department inspection reports filed by an increasingly conflicted inspector who begins documenting not violations but grief rituals, her bureaucratic language slowly cracking open as she's drawn into the chef's system of edible memorials. The pivotal tension: the mechanic discovers his late wife ate at the chef's Beirut restaurant the day before the explosion, and now must decide whether knowing what she ordered—her last meal—will stabilize or destroy him.

**Form:** Health department inspection reports with handwritten marginalia
