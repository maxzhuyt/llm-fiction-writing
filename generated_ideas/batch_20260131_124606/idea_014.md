**Story Idea:**

A property assessor for a rural county discovers that one wealthy family has been systematically underreporting the acreage of their sheep farm for three generations—but the "missing" land corresponds exactly to parcels where seven people have disappeared since 1952. The story unfolds through her official field notes, which begin as dry measurements and legal descriptions but gradually incorporate personal observations she knows she should not be recording in government documents. The tension comes from watching her decide, entry by entry, whether to file the report that will authorize an investigation—knowing the family has a representative on every local board, and that her predecessor in this job left abruptly, his final assessment mysteriously incomplete.
