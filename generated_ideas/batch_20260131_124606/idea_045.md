**Form: Annotated psychological evaluation transcript, with handwritten marginalia from three different reviewers**

A court-appointed psychologist must determine whether a death row inmate's claim is genuine: that he can predict—with documented accuracy—the exact moment anyone he meets will die, and that he killed his victims specifically *because* their deaths were already inevitable within hours, making him, in his view, a mercy rather than a murderer. The transcript shows the psychologist's growing horror as she realizes the inmate has correctly predicted verifiable deaths seventeen times, including—mentioned offhandedly mid-session—her own, scheduled for "shortly after you finish your final report." The marginalia reveals each reviewer reaching different conclusions about whether to include or suppress this information, their handwriting growing increasingly frantic as the document's completion date approaches.
