**Story Idea:**

A township clerk in 1950s Florida discovers that the quarterly "soil propagation reports" she's been filing for the county agricultural board are actually coded messages coordinating the disappearance of Black migrant farmworkers—and the next report, due in three days, contains her brother-in-law Dwight's name. The story unfolds through her meticulous modification of bureaucratic forms, trace evidence she photographs with a borrowed camera, and letters to a cousin in Chicago she's not sure she can trust. The tension lies in her weapon being the very paperwork meant to erase these men: she must decide whether to alter the codes to save Dwight while condemning a stranger, or expose the system and bankrupt any chance of her family's survival in a town where she's already suspect.

**Form:** Interleaved bureaucratic documents (agricultural reports, form amendments, filing receipts) and unsent letter drafts, with the clerk's increasingly frantic marginal annotations revealing what the official language conceals.
