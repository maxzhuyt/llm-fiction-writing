**Story Idea:**

A immigration officer at a major international airport discovers she can predict with uncanny accuracy which travelers are about to die—not from danger, but from a faint luminescence only she perceives around them. When she spots the glow on a teenager traveling alone, she faces an impossible choice: intervene and expose her inexplicable ability, or stamp the passport and let fate proceed. The story unfolds through the official incident report she's forced to file after making her decision, her clinical bureaucratic language increasingly fracturing as she tries to justify actions that no form was designed to contain.

**Form:** Official Department of Homeland Security incident report with handwritten marginalia and crossed-out sections
