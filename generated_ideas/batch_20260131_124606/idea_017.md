**Story Idea:**

A agricultural gene bank archivist discovers that her predecessor—a distinguished botanist who died in a suspicious "equipment malfunction"—had been secretly cataloging which seed varieties were being deleted from the digital database rather than physically destroyed, suggesting someone is engineering a selective extinction event in the global food supply. The story unfolds through her annotated corrections to the official incident report she's required to file, where her margin notes, crossed-out sentences, and increasingly desperate addendums reveal both the conspiracy and her growing certainty that submitting the truth will make her the next malfunction. The form itself becomes the plot: we watch her craft careful bureaucratic language in the main text while her handwritten annotations show what she actually found in the seed vault's sub-basement—and her final, stable version of the report, stripped of all annotations, tells us her conclusion without stating it.
