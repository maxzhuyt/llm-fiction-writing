**Story Idea:**

A municipal archivist discovers that her city's property records contain deliberate gaps—marginal notations in pencil that, when mapped across decades of matrices, reveal a pattern of homes systematically excluded from official surveys. The missing addresses form a spiral staircase shape across the city grid, and at its center sits a condemned jail that census records insist has been empty since 1932, though utility bills show continuous mercury vapor lamp usage. Told through her increasingly frantic research log entries, cross-referenced with the original documents she's photographing, the story follows her realization that the bureaucratic erasure wasn't meant to hide what happened in those spaces—it was meant to keep something from finding its way out by following its own paper trail.
