**Story Idea:**

A conservation specialist at a maritime museum discovers that a recently acquired Viking-era textile contains a pattern that perfectly matches the wear marks on her late grandmother's vintage naval uniform—marks the family always assumed came from WWII service, but which now suggest her grandmother participated in something far older and stranger. The story unfolds through alternating museum acquisition reports (clinical, procedural) and the grandmother's unsent letters found in the uniform's lining, which grow increasingly desperate as they describe a 1943 naval mission that somehow intersected with a preserved Norse vessel in Arctic waters. The specialist must argue for extended research time while her colleagues push to spread news of the "coincidental" pattern match, never suspecting that the compatibility between the two artifacts isn't coincidence at all—and that the grandmother's letters warn explicitly against bringing them together again.
