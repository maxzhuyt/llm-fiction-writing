**Story Idea:**

A trauma surgeon at a remote Antarctic research station receives a formal allegation via satellite uplink: she's accused of murdering a patient during a blackout surgery three years ago in São Paulo—a surgery she has no memory of performing. The story unfolds through her research log entries as she investigates her own past while simultaneously treating a colleague whose throat was crushed in a "mechanical accident," gradually realizing the same person who filed the allegation is now among the twelve scientists wintering with her, and the adjacent berths in their sleeping quarters mean she can hear someone whispering her surgical notes back to her each night. The crystallizing horror isn't whether she killed before—it's recognizing the psychological profile emerging in her own logs matches the station's pattern of "accidents" perfectly.
