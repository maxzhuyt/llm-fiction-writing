**Story Idea:**

A wildlife biologist studying cougar populations in the California foothills discovers that somebody has been falsely reporting sightings to manipulate land-use surveys—and her own research partner of twelve years is the source. Told through interleaved field notes, the story traces her methodical documentation of the betrayal alongside her genuine observations, the scientific detachment of her entries gradually cracking to reveal the misery of dismantling both a career collaboration and an unspoken intimacy she'd never named. The final entry records her decision: submit the falsified data that would protect him and secure conservation funding, or the truth that would save her integrity but doom the actual cougars to development. What makes it impossible to put down is watching a woman who built her life on empirical observation confront a problem where every verifiable fact leads to the wrong answer.
