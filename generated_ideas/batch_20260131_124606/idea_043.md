**Story Idea:**

A Vatican archivist discovers that the marble saints in St. Peter's Basilica have been slowly shifting positions over centuries—documented in marginalia notations dismissed as monk's errors—and realizes they're converging on a single crypt. The story unfolds through her research log intercut with the *memoria* entries of a 16th-century sculptor who deliberately encoded a warning into his work, having witnessed something in the stone that made him chisel his own eyes out rather than see it completed. The archivist must decode his playful-seeming artistic flourishes before the statues complete their centuries-long pilgrimage on the winter solstice, when the shadow alignment will finally permit whatever waits below to encounter its first living witness.
