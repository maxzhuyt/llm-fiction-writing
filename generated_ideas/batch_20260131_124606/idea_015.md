**Story Idea:**

A retired insurance billing specialist discovers that her late husband—a mild shepherd in rural Wales for forty years—was flagged in declassified 1970s documents as a Soviet "comparator," someone who verified the identities of deep-cover agents by simply *looking* at them. The story unfolds through her formal inquiry letters to MI5, their increasingly nervous bureaucratic responses, and her own marginalia as she realizes the man who fetched her tea each morning possessed an eidetic memory for faces he weaponized during "stone collecting holidays" across Europe. The question consuming her final months: did he stay in the marriage because he loved her, or because she worked at a hospital where Eastern Bloc diplomats sought treatment—and does the distinction still matter now that she's found the toggle-switched radio behind the lambing shed wall?

**Form:** Epistolary collage—official correspondence, FOIA responses with redactions, handwritten notes in margins, one unsent letter to her dead husband.
