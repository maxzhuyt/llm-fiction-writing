**Story Idea:**

A transmission repair technician in a dying rust belt town discovers that her late father—a man she believed was a simple mechanic named Edgar—had spent forty years secretly maintaining the town's entire infrastructure alone, from water mains to electrical grids, without any official employment or payment. The story unfolds through her interviews with increasingly uncomfortable town officials who knew about this arrangement and exploited it. The core question becomes not why he did it, but why the town let him—and what happens now that the one person holding everything together is gone and his daughter must decide whether to inherit his invisible, uncompensated labor or let the town finally face what it refused to pay for.

**Form:** Transcript of a local public access radio show where the daughter has called in, initially to discuss her father's obituary, but the conversation spirals as listeners phone in with confessions.
