**Story Idea:**

A pressure cooker explosion at a chemical plant releases an unregistered compound that causes everyone within a half-mile radius to involuntarily vocalize their concealed thoughts for exactly 72 hours. The story unfolds through the frantic internal memos of the company's crisis management team, who must coordinate damage control while their own buried resentments, affairs, and misconduct keep interrupting their professional communications—each memo growing more unhinged as employees try to type formal language while grunting out confessions they can't stop. The liberation some workers feel collides with others' desperate attempts to stay silent, and the memos gradually reveal that the "accident" was engineered by an agent from a rival company who is now trapped inside, exposed alongside everyone else.
