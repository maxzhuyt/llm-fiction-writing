**Story Idea:**

A hospital organ transplant coordinator discovers that her department has been systematically matching kidney donors to recipients based not on medical compatibility, but on an underground auction accessible only to board members—and the encrypted bidding platform is hosted on the hospital's own servers, hidden in a maintenance corridor's forgotten terminal. The story unfolds through her increasingly paranoid work emails, IT help tickets that go unanswered, and late-night voice memos as she tries to document evidence while realizing the rotating cast of "equipment inspectors" visiting her floor are tracking her keycard movements. The impossible choice: sever her career and risk her family by going public with incomplete proof, or stay alive long enough to comprehend the full scope of a system that has already flagged her as a breach.

**Form:** Interleaved digital artifacts—work emails with CC chains that reveal who's complicit, IT ticket responses that gaslight, timestamped voice memos growing more fragmented, and finally, a single automated calendar invite for a "performance review" in a basement room that doesn't appear on any floor plan.
