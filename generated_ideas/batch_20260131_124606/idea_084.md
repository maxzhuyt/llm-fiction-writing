**Story Idea:**

A medical resident at a rural hospital begins receiving anonymous electronic messages containing diagnostic predictions for patients who haven't yet arrived—predictions that prove eerily accurate, including one for a patient who will die unless the resident violates hospital protocol. Told through a fragmented grouping of text message screenshots, incident reports, and therapy session transcripts, the story follows her increasingly desperate attempts to examine the source while absorbing the moral weight of acting on information she cannot explain. The chilling twist: the messages are coming from her own phone number, timestamped three days in the future, and the final prediction names her as the patient.
