**Story Idea:**

A municipal tax collector in a dying steel town discovers that the titanium processing plant—the last major employer—has been paying property taxes into an account that doesn't exist for eleven years, and the discrepancy traces back to her own deceased father's tenure in her role. Told through her increasingly frantic interoffice memos to a supervisor who keeps retiring her inquiries as "irrelevant to current fiscal priorities," the story follows her realization that the corruption isn't a crime but a bipartisan act of mercy: the plant closed a decade ago, and the entire town has been collectively pretending otherwise to maintain employment records that keep 200 families on state benefits. The final memo, marked "DISCRETION ADVISED," is her request for guidance on whether to file her report or burn it—submitted to an office she now suspects has been empty for years.
