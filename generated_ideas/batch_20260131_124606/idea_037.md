**Form: Annotated library catalog cards, increasingly frantic margin notes**

A children's librarian discovers that her predecessor—who vanished in 1987—had been systematically removing final chapters from picture books and replacing them with subtly wrong endings that she wrote herself. As the current librarian tracks down the original pages hidden throughout the building, the margin notes she leaves on the catalog cards reveal she's begun to doubt her own childhood memories of these stories, unclear whether she read the originals or the replacements. The predecessor's annotations, found later, suggest she believed the "imaginary" friends children described from these books were real entities that could only be banished by altering the narratives that summoned them—and that one such entity has been awaiting the restoration of its story for decades.
