**Story Idea:**

A genetics researcher discovers that a specific allele sequence appears in DNA samples from a remote Peruvian *sitio*—samples that were supposedly destroyed in a 1970s military operation she's now uncovered were commanded by her own grandfather. Told through layered supplemental materials to a congressional inquiry (lab reports, redacted cables, her grandfather's field notes, tissue sample chain-of-custody forms), the narrative reveals the ambiguity of whether she's exposing a atrocity or being manipulated by someone capable of fabricating decades of evidence. The story becomes impossible to put down because each document that seems to clarify the truth introduces a new questionable element, and the researcher's own commentary grows increasingly unreliable as her professional credibility and family loyalty enter mutually exclusive territory.
