**Story Idea:**

A corporate spokesman for a pharmaceutical company discovers, through his estranged daughter's deteriorating medical records, that his employer suppressed trial data showing their flagship drug accelerates neurological decay in patients under 25—and she's been on it for three years. The story unfolds through his carefully maintained "media response preparation documents," which begin as sanitized talking points but gradually transform into confession, legal strategy, and finally, desperate letters to a colleague he's trying to recruit as a whistleblower. The twist: the colleague has been forwarding everything to the company's legal team, and the final document is a termination letter that quotes his own damning words back to him, shortly before his daughter's next prescription renewal is due.
