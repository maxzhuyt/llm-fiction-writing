**Story Idea:**

A celebrity hair stylist discovers that her longtime client—a beloved religious television host—died of an overdose three days ago, yet someone wearing the host's face continues appearing on live broadcasts, waving to studio audiences who notice nothing wrong. The story unfolds through the stylist's increasingly frantic text messages to her sister, interspersed with screenshots of the show's comment sections where exactly seven viewers across the country keep posting "that's not her hair" before their accounts disappear. The stylist must decide whether to stay silent or go public, knowing her own prints are on the styling tools found near the original corpse.
