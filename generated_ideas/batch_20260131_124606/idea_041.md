**Story Idea:**

A pediatric neurologist who runs a prestigious children's hospital discovers that the state's new "regulated naming protocols"—bureaucratic filings that assign children temporary number-designations until age five—are causing a previously unknown developmental condition she's calling "identity dolor." The story unfolds through her increasingly desperate hospital memos, which begin as dry clinical assessments but gradually convert into coded resistance communications as she realizes the policy isn't a mistake but a deliberate interruption of parent-child bonding. The final memo, addressed to "Patient 2847-F (whom her mother briefly called 'Elena')," is a confession that the neurologist has been forging naming certificates—and instructions for continuing the work after her upcoming arrest.
