**Form: Longitudinal research log spanning 40 years, with increasingly erratic margin notes**

A behavioral psychologist begins a career-long study tracking children who survived a 1984 school bus accident in rural Philippe County, Arkansas—all twelve developed an identical recurring dream they refuse to describe to outsiders. Her scientific detachment erodes as she discovers each subject, upon turning 40, visits the same unmarked grave in different years and leaves the same object: a child's lunchbox containing a single uneaten snack, perfectly preserved. The final entries, written as she approaches her own 40th birthday, reveal she was the thirteenth passenger—the one whose survival was never recorded, whose memory of the accident remains contingent on the others continuing to dream.
