**Story Idea:**

A mid-level embassy translator in a fictional Eastern European nation (Dobroslav-Ville) discovers that the diplomatic agreement she's been translating contains a hidden second text—an alternate version encoded in the spacing between words that contradicts everything in the official document. Told through her increasingly paranoid marginalia and personal annotations scrawled in the document's margins, the story follows her attempt to warn someone while retaining her cover, even as she becomes convinced the ambassador's assistant Michelle has noticed her noticing. The form gradually shifts from professional translation notes to desperate forward-dated letters to her sister, hidden between the pages, as she realizes the "dust" protocol referenced in the shadow text refers to her own elimination.
