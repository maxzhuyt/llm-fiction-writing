**Story Idea:**

A mid-level finance officer at a volcanic monitoring station discovers that her agency has been deliberately suppressing eruption warnings to avoid triggering insurance clauses that would bankrupt a major governmental sponsorship deal. The story unfolds through her increasingly frantic internal memos—each stamped "RECEIVED" but never answered—as she tries to escalate warnings through proper channels while the seismic data grows more catastrophic. The constraint she faces: the only person with authority to order evacuation is the lieutenant governor, who brokered the sponsorship. What makes it impossible to put down is watching her formal bureaucratic language slowly crack under moral pressure, her memos becoming shorter, more desperate, until the final one is just a timestamp and three words.
