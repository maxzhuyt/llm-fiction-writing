**Story Idea:**

A mid-level bureaucrat in a fictional Eastern European finance ministry discovers that the catastrophic currency collapse destroying his country was deliberately engineered by his own government—and the proof is buried in the cancellation codes of a single foreign aid installment he processed six months ago. The story unfolds through his increasingly paranoid desk calendar notations, interdepartmental memos he's hoarding, and the torn-out pages he's hiding in a waterproof pouch taped inside his toilet tank. What makes it impossible to put down: he's not trying to expose the conspiracy—he's trying to figure out how to profit from it before fleeing, and we watch his moral calculations shift entry by entry as the peso-equivalent becomes worthless and his escape window narrows.

**Form:** Bureaucratic ephemera—calendar entries, routing slips, handwritten marginalia on official documents, and one unsent letter to his estranged daughter that keeps getting revised.
