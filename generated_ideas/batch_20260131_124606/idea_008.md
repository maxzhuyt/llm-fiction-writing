**Story Idea:**

A 1950s housewife discovers her husband—a cheerful baker in their small Pennsylvania town—is actually a former Nazi camp guard when she finds his old SS identification hidden in a stainless steel canister behind the flour bins. The story unfolds through her private journal entries over six weeks as she grapples with whether to report him, complicated by her genuine love, their three children, and her growing realization that several "respectable" men in their German-American community share similar secrets. The tension becomes unbearable when a Holocaust survivor opens a tailor shop on Main Street and her husband's wrist tattoo removal scar suddenly makes sense—she must choose between the warmth of her constructed life and an impossible act of moral courage that will destroy everything she knows.
