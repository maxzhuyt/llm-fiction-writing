**Story Idea:**

A geographic survey team mapping contested border territory between two provinces discovers their landlord—the elderly woman renting them rooms—is the plaintiff in a 40-year property lawsuit that will determine which nation owns the land they're standing on. Told through the surveyor's field notes, the story follows her growing realization that her "objective" measurements are being subtly manipulated by both governments, while the landlord treats the whole geopolitical crisis as secondary to her actual concern: someone in the village has been stabbing holes in her prize-winning rose bushes. The notes begin as dry technical observations but increasingly break format as the surveyor starts documenting the old woman's testimony about the original border war, until the final entry reveals the surveyor has stopped measuring entirely and instead drawn a map based on where the roses grow.
