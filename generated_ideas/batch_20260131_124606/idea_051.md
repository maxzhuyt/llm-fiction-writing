**Story Idea:**

A retired puzzle designer for escape rooms discovers that someone has been using her old designs as blueprints for actual burglaries across Adelaide—and the police consider her a suspect. Told through her increasingly frantic correspondence with the detective assigned to her case, she must reverse-engineer her own creations to predict the next heist, while her letters reveal she's battling early-onset memory loss and can't fully trust her own recollections of what she designed. The tension escalates when she realizes the thief's pattern suggests intimate knowledge of modifications she made but never documented—changes she now can't remember making.

**Form:** One-sided correspondence (her letters to the detective, with his responses implied through her reactions)
