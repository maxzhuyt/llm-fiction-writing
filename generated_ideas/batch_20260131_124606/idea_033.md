**Story Idea:**

A volcanologist discovers that the "fossil" record inside a dormant Pacific volcano contains impossible evidence—organic patterns that predate Earth's formation by billions of years, arranged in what appears to be a deliberate hierarchy of symbols. The story unfolds through her increasingly frantic grant proposal revisions to the NSF, each draft growing more hesitant and hedging as she realizes that writing plainly what she's found will end her career, while her footnotes and tracked changes reveal the brilliant, terrifying truth she keeps deleting. The final draft she submits is appropriately boring and fundable; the version she emails to her estranged brother Hans—a theologian she hasn't spoken to in twelve years—is not.
