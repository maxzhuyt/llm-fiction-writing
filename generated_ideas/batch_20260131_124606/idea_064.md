**Story Idea:**

A pharmaceutical researcher's lab notebook documents her development of a nicotine-derivative compound meant to treat depression, but the entries gradually reveal she's been testing injectable doses on herself while assuming her dead twin sister's identity at a remote Vermont facility. The scientific observations grow increasingly unreliable—dosage notes interrupted by conversations with "herself," data modifications she doesn't remember making, three separate handwriting styles emerging across the pages. The notebook ends mid-sentence during what appears to be a breakthrough, and the final page contains only a photograph of two women who look nothing alike.
