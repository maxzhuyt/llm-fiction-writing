**Story Idea:**

A railway engineer in 1915 Aleppo intercepts a coded German telegram meant for Franco-Ottoman military command, but the message appears to contain theological references that match his dead brother Nathan's private journals exactly—journals that never left Boston. Told through the engineer's increasingly frantic field notes and sketched diagrams, the story follows his attempt to reconcile the physiological impossibility of what he's seeing with the solid evidence before him, even as he realizes responding to the message might mean acknowledging his brother is alive, a traitor, or something worse. The interception forces him to choose between reporting up the chain of command and protecting a family mission he never knew existed.
