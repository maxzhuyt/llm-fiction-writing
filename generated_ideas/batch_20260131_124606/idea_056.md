**Story Idea:**

A hospice nurse named Martha discovers that her dying patients, in their final lucid moments, keep speaking fragments of the same opera—one that doesn't exist in any archive. Told through her increasingly obsessive research log entries interspersed with transcribed patient recordings, she traces the melody backward through decades of deathbed utterances to a 1952 psychiatric hospital where patients were used as test subjects for a memory-erasure program. The story becomes impossible to put down when Martha realizes she knows the opera's finale by heart, though she has no memory of ever learning it—and her own medical files contain an abbreviation she's seen in the redacted research: "REGRESS-7, iteration successful."
