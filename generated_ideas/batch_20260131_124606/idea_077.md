**Story Idea:**

A young environmental engineer stationed on a remote Pacific island discovers that the "transitional housing" she's been designing for climate refugees is actually an elaborate setup for something far darker—the displaced ethnic communities are being isolated for a corporate pharmaceutical trial they never consented to. The story unfolds through her field notebook entries, which begin as mundane technical observations about terrain and water systems but gradually fill with coded warnings as she realizes her satellite phone is monitored and her beard-growing colleague "Bruce" from corporate isn't an engineer at all. The impossible-to-put-down element: she can't simply leave or blow the whistle because the refugees have grown to trust her, and abandoning the project means abandoning them to whatever comes next—so her notebooks become both confession and evidence, written for whoever finds them after.
