**Form: Therapist's session notes, increasingly erratic**

A child psychologist begins documenting sessions with a seven-year-old who claims her imaginary friend is "training" her for something she calls "the cutoff"—a date three weeks away. The therapist's clinical observations grow obsessive as the girl demonstrates knowledge she couldn't possess: the doctor's dead sister's name, the combination to locked drawers in the office, details of a crime that hasn't been reported yet. The notes slowly reveal the therapist's own grip loosening—entries shift from diagnostic distance to desperate attempts to submit the child for emergency evaluation, blocked at every turn by parents who seem rehearsed, by supervisors who don't return calls, by a growing suspicion that the "training" isn't meant for the girl at all.
