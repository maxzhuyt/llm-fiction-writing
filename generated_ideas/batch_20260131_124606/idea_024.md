**Story Idea:**

A wallpaper conservator restoring a Victorian mansion discovers that beneath seven layers of paper, someone has written the same woman's name—Kate—in increasingly frantic handwriting spanning decades, always hidden by the next layer within days of completion. The story unfolds through her scientific analysis reports, which begin as dry documentation of chemical compounds and saturation damage but gradually become obsessive as she realizes the dates of each wallpapering correspond exactly to local disappearances, and the ceiling above shows evidence of something heavy being dragged toward a now-plastered alcove. The final report is addressed not to her employer but to the current owner, who she's just discovered is the seventh Kate to live in the house—and who hired her specifically because the conservator herself is the eighth.
