**Story Idea:**

A Vietnamese-American woman receives a package containing her late grandmother's handwritten recipe notebook from 1968 Saigon, but the baking instructions are interspersed with coded messages that, when decoded, reveal her grandmother was feeding intelligence to multiple sides of the war—and that a now-prominent American politician named David Marsh was her handler. The story unfolds through the granddaughter's annotations in the notebook margins as she tests each recipe while unraveling the cipher, discovering that her family's immigration was not refugee flight but extraction, and that someone is currently scanning her internet searches about Marsh. The recipes work perfectly; the woman must decide whether the truth is worth surfacing when her grandmother clearly chose silence.

**Form:** Annotated cookbook with marginal notes, interspersed with browser history timestamps and search queries.
