**Story Idea:**

A furniture restorer specializing in antique ottomans discovers that her clients' suppressed memories are literally trapped in the horsehair stuffing—and she's been inhaling fragments of strangers' traumas for years, unable to distinguish their grief from her own. When she finds a coded message sewn into a 1943 piece, she must decide whether to eliminate the evidence of a war crime or return it to the elderly customer who clearly hid it there deliberately and now claims to remember nothing. The story unfolds through her workshop inventory logs, increasingly erratic margin notes, and the formal appraisal letters she drafts but never sends.
