**Story Idea:**

A Swiss canton's records office receives a misfiled death certificate dated fifteen years in the future—for the clerk processing it. Told through increasingly frantic bureaucratic correspondence between municipal departments, each attempting to bypass responsibility for the impossible document, the story follows the clerk's comparative analysis of her own predicted death against public records, discovering that similar "forwarding errors" preceded every major accident in the region for the past century. The final memo, stamped and filed by her replacement, is dated exactly as predicted.
