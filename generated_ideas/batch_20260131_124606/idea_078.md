**Story Idea:**

A rural veterinarian in 1970s Morocco receives a letter from a twin brother she was never told existed—a scientist at a failing experimental farm who claims their estrangement was engineered by their parents to protect a family secret involving inherited memory. The story unfolds through her field notebook as she travels to find him, her clinical observations of dying livestock gradually giving way to uncanny recognitions: she knows the layout of buildings she's never seen, the names of animals she's never met. The notebook's final entries are written in a handwriting that isn't quite hers anymore, documenting a "turnaround" she can't fully explain—and a curious provision in their parents' will that only makes sense if consciousness can be appended to consciousness like grafting branches onto rootstock.
