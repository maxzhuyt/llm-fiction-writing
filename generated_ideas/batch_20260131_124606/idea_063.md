**Story Idea:**

A bureaucratic report from the Ministry of Temporal Integrity documents the "wholesale substitution" of a renowned physicist who died in 1962—someone has been inserting an emulator into historical photographs, lecture recordings, and even peer-reviewed papers, and the unsigned modifications are so seamless that reality itself seems uncertain about which version of the scientist was "original." The investigating agent grows increasingly unhinged in her margin notes as she realizes the substituted physicist's theories actually *work better* than the original's, raising the question of whether this is sabotage or an upgrade. The report ends mid-sentence, with a Form 77-B attachment indicating the agent herself has been flagged for replacement review.
