**Story Idea:**

A taxonomy instructor at a natural history museum discovers that her deceased predecessor embedded a cipher within the genus classifications of the insect collection—a system that, once decoded, reveals he was documenting corporate espionage for a pesticide corporation through specimen acquisition dates and location tags. The story unfolds through her scientific field notes, which begin as dry cataloging observations but gradually transform into increasingly paranoid entries as she realizes someone is rearranging specimens overnight to scramble the code. The form allows her to hide her own investigation within legitimate-sounding taxonomic descriptions, creating a double cipher the reader must parse alongside her.
