**Form: Annotated auction catalog with handwritten marginalia**

A recently widowed art appraiser discovers that her late husband—a seemingly unremarkable accountant—spent thirty years secretly acquiring items from estate sales, each connected to a 1970s unsolved disappearance she's never heard of. The catalog for his collection's auction becomes her investigative notebook, her analytical marginalia transforming sterile lot descriptions ("Pallet of water-damaged journals, $15 starting bid") into a map of obsession. What she uncovers suggests her husband wasn't investigating the disappearance—he was methodically erasing evidence of it, and the auction's spotlight on his collection has drawn the attention of someone who needs those items to stay hidden.
