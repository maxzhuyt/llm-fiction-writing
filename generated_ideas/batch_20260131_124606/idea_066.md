**Form: Custody evaluation report with handwritten margin notes**

A family court psychologist in Canberra is assigned to evaluate a bitter divorce case where both parents claim the other is "plotting" to alienate their teenage daughter—but her margin notes reveal she's increasingly convinced the daughter is the one manipulating both parents with surgical precision, recreating the exact psychological recursion the evaluator used to destroy her own parents' marriage thirty years ago. The report grows increasingly erratic as the psychologist realizes the girl has somehow obtained her own sealed juvenile records. The final official recommendation is typed and professional; the margins contain only the words "she knows what I did" repeated in deteriorating handwriting.
