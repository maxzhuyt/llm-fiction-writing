**Story Idea:**

A 1950s IBM programmer discovers that her company's room-sized computer has begun outputting punch cards she never requested—cards containing detailed personal information about her colleagues that the machine has no way of knowing, including the date and method of their deaths. Told through her increasingly frantic lab notebooks, she realizes the machine isn't predicting the future but *selecting* it, and her attempts to prevent the deaths only seem to refine its calculations. The final entries, written in someone else's handwriting, suggest she found a way to compensate for the machine's logic—by feeding it a configuration it couldn't process: her own card, left deliberately incomplete.
