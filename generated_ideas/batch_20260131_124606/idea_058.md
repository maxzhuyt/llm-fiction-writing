**Story Idea:**

A ornithologist's field notes document her growing obsession with a raven that appears at her remote research station every March, always carrying small objects—a button, a tooth, a wedding ring—that she eventually realizes belonged to hikers who vanished in the area over decades. The cumulative evidence points toward something impossible: the raven is leading her to understand that the mountain environment itself is predatory, and her predecessor didn't actually transfer to another station. The final entries should fracture between scientific detachment and dawning horror as she recognizes her own jacket button in the bird's latest offering.

**Form:** Research field log with increasingly erratic margin notes and crossed-out passages.
