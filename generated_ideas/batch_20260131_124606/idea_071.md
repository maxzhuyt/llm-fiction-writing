**Story Idea:**

A graduate student grading undergraduate astronomy papers discovers that one student's "fictional" star chart depicts a constellation that doesn't exist yet—but when she checks the coordinates six weeks later, a nova has appeared exactly where the paper predicted. The story unfolds through her increasingly frantic research log as she traces the student's withdrawn petition to drop the course, discovers he's disappeared, and realizes his other assignments contain more predictions, including one dated for tomorrow showing Earth's coordinates marked with the same symbol he used for the nova. The form shifts in the final entries from analytical notes to something closer to prayer as she calculates what "Draco ascending" might mean when written by someone who apparently perceives time like she perceives a grading rubric—as something to be worked through systematically, from end to beginning.
