**Story Idea:**

A Vatican plumber discovers that the basement pipes beneath St. Peter's form a precise geometric pattern matching an electron orbital diagram—one that predates atomic theory by three centuries. Told through his increasingly frantic work orders and maintenance logs, the story follows his attempts to document the anomaly while someone keeps reassigning him to different buildings. The logs reveal he's not the first maintenance worker to notice; he finds annotations in the margins from predecessors dating back decades, each ending mid-sentence, and now he understands why the Vatican has its own plumbing department that never hires from outside.
