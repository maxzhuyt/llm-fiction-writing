**Form: Fragmented research log with increasingly erratic margin annotations**

A longitudinal study tracking identical twins separated at birth reveals impossible data: their medical markers, life choices, and even death dates are converging with numerical precision despite zero contact—until the surviving researcher realizes she's been documenting not coincidence but a single consciousness split across two bodies, and her own twin sister died at birth. The log entries grow obsessive as she uncovers that the study's original pioneer deliberately selected subjects showing this phenomenon, leaving coded notes about a "threshold" where individuality becomes statistically meaningless. The final entries are written in two distinct handwritings, both claiming to be her.
