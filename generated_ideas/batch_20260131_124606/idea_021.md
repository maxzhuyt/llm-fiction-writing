**Story Idea:**

A veterinary geneticist working to resurrect extinct species discovers that her lab's latest "creature"—a thylacine clone—has been secretly gestating for months inside a surrogate using DNA spliced from mass grave samples in Tasmania, where colonial hunters committed systematic extermination. The story unfolds through her grant renewal application, which she's rewriting in real-time as she uncovers that her research partner has been falsifying equilibrium reports to hide that the clone is developing abnormalities—and that the funding body already knows, because they want the failure documented to justify banning resurrection biology entirely. She must decide whether to submit the honest version that ends her career but saves the suffering animal, or the fabricated version that continues a project built on the silence surrounding what was done to both the species and the Aboriginal people who once shared its land.
