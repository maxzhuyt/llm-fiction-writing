**Story Idea:**

A genomics researcher discovers that her late mentor—a senior scientist celebrated for a groundbreaking restoration technique for endangered species—secretly inserted synthetic trait sequences into the genome of what became the world's most successful conservation project, essentially creating a new organism while claiming to save an old one. The story unfolds through the researcher's scientific notebook as she replicates his experiments, her clinical observations growing increasingly personal as she realizes the distinction between "restoration" and "experiment" may be meaningless, and that exposing him would collapse a decade of conservation policy while staying silent makes her complicit in something she can't quite name. The notebook's final entries become fragmented and contradictory as she discovers the synthetic sequences are now appearing in wild populations—the "restored" species is outcompeting its genuine relatives, and her mentor's furnace-hot ambition has accidentally authored an extinction while trying to prevent one.
