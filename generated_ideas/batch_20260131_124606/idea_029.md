**Story Idea:**

A Belgian archivist discovers that her recently deceased aunt left behind a manuscript claiming to have worked as a "narrative consultant" for a secret EU department that scripts minor political crises to prevent larger ones—complete with documentary evidence of events the archivist remembers living through as spontaneous. The story unfolds through the aunt's annotated work logs, personal letters defending her choices, and the archivist's increasingly paranoid margin notes as she realizes she herself may have been a planted "ripple element" in one of the operations. The form is the manuscript itself, with three competing layers of handwriting arguing across decades about whether orchestrated tragedy can ever be ethical if it prevents worse outcomes.
