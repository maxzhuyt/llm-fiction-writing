**Story Idea:**

A pharmaceutical company's ethics compliance officer discovers that their high-margin anxiety medication contains a compound that subtly suppresses facial micro-expressions—patients report feeling better but their families describe them as "gone behind the eyes." The story unfolds through her increasingly frantic internal reports, each one kicked back by legal with thinner and thinner justifications, intercut with her personal prescription refill notifications showing she's been on the drug for three years. The final document is a form letter celebrating her "liberation" into early retirement, countersigned by her own handwriting she doesn't remember using.
