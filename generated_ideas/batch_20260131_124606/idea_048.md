**Story Idea:**

A youth hockey goalie begins receiving handwritten letters from her estranged uncle—a man her family insists died in a warehouse fire eleven years ago—each letter containing increasingly specific instructions she must follow "or the curse passes to the next keeper." The story unfolds through her private Moodle messages with a school counselor she's forbidden to actually meet with, where she oscillates between terrified obedience and desperate attempts to prove the letters are a hoax, all while her save percentage climbs to statistically impossible levels. The counselor's responses grow more concerned, then more interested in the "techniques" the letters describe, until the girl realizes she's been confiding in someone who knows details about the fire no stranger should possess.

**Form:** Learning management system message thread with sporadic uploaded photos of the letters themselves, timestamped and gradually revealing the counselor's responses shifting from therapeutic distance to hungry familiarity.
