**Story Idea:**

A Vatican archivist discovers that her predecessor—who died under mysterious circumstances last December—had been secretly reconstructing a suppressed 16th-century Spanish text proving the Church deliberately edited out evidence of a "gravity miracle" that would have validated a rival religion. The story unfolds through her research log entries, increasingly paranoid margin notes, and intercepted internal memos revealing she's being watched by the same office that monitored her predecessor. The intriguing question driving the narrative isn't whether the miracle was real, but why the Church continues protecting a 500-year-old lie badly enough to kill for it—and whether she's already past the point where they'd let her walk away.
