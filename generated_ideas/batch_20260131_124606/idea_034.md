**Story Idea:**

A food critic for a dying alt-weekly discovers that a reclusive shrimp rancher in the Texas panhandle—a former Marxist revolutionary who fled Argentina in 1978—has been encoding dissidents' names and testimonies into the breeding patterns of his crustaceans, creating a living genetic archive of the disappeared. Told through the critic's submitted restaurant reviews that her editor keeps rejecting as "too political," each piece ostensibly about Gulf seafood restaurants becomes an increasingly desperate investigation as she realizes someone is systematically buying out and destroying the bloodlines. The mounting tension between her professional voice and personal terror creates dark comedy until the final review, which her editor runs posthumously, not understanding it's a confession about what she agreed to forget in exchange for her life.
