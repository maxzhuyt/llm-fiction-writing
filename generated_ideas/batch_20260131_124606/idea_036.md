**Story Idea:**

A wildlife biologist's field notes document her growing obsession with a jaguar she's tracking through the Pantanal—an animal she realizes is hunting *her* back with deliberate, almost theatrical intelligence, appearing at the edges of her camp in poses that feel like communication. Her scientific observations gradually deteriorate into something between love letters and prey-animal fixation as she begins leaving herself as the lure, abandoning her research partner Pedro to follow the cat deeper into flooded forest. The final entries, written in increasingly erratic handwriting, argue that the jaguar has been selectively approaching only researchers who share a specific genetic marker—a mutation her university's archived blood samples could confirm—and that being chosen is a fortune she refuses to escape.
