**Story Idea:**

A environmental compliance officer reviewing quarterly logs from a waterfront brewery in Bern discovers that the company's accelerated fermentation process depends on an anomaly in their water source—one that shouldn't exist according to every hydrogeological survey. As she digs deeper, she finds that four previous inspectors were reassigned after filing prelim reports on this facility, and the brewery's parent company has just offered her a dangerously desirable promotion to their corporate headquarters. The story unfolds through her official field notes, which begin as dry bureaucratic documentation but gradually reveal her mounting paranoia through increasingly erratic margins annotations, crossed-out sections, and a final entry that consists only of GPS coordinates and the words "quaternion pattern in the sediment—they're not making beer."

**Form:** Regulatory field notes with handwritten marginalia, interspersed with official correspondence and one partially redacted corporate memo.
