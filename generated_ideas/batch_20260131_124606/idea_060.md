**Story Idea:**

A retired Ohio schoolteacher receives a locked cedar box from her estranged sister's estate, containing a chronicle of diary entries that reveal their mother—a 1950s housewife—spent two years as an underground "helper" smuggling pregnant women across state lines for illegal abortions, until one case ended in tragedy that the family buried for decades. The story unfolds through the mother's original sparse, coded diary entries interleaved with the daughter's present-day annotations as she wrestles with resentment toward a sister who knew this secret and never shared it, while gradually recognizing her own life choices as an educator were shaped by a rebellion she never understood. The final entry reveals the mother's last "client" was her own sister—the narrator's aunt she was always told died of influenza.

**Form:** Annotated diary with dual timeframes—1956 entries in the mother's voice with 2019 marginal notes, footnotes, and crossed-out reactions from the discovering daughter.
