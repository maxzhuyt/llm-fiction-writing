**Story Idea:**

A Atlanta-based forensic accountant discovers that her recently deceased father—a beloved populist preacher known for his moral crusades—had been running a decades-long financial sham, and the evidence is buried in the unfinished sermon notes she inherited. The story unfolds through her annotations in the margins of his handwritten sermons, where her increasingly desperate comments intersect with his soaring rhetoric about righteousness, revealing the exact moment in her adolescence when he first faced the choice to become a fraud. The form allows readers to watch her faith in him die line by line, while simultaneously understanding how a man who began with genuine zeal convinced himself that holy ends justified hollow means.

**Primary Form:** Annotated manuscript—a dead preacher's sermon drafts with his daughter's forensic marginalia, dated entries showing her investigation over three weeks.
