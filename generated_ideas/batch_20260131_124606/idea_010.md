**Story Idea:**

A mid-level bureaucrat in Arizona's state adoption agency discovers that her department has been systematically delaying placements for same-sex couples—not through explicit policy, but through an informal "padding" of processing times that no one will admit exists. The story unfolds through her increasingly desperate internal memos, which begin as routine procedural suggestions and evolve into a paper trail documenting her attempt to force accountability from colleagues who insist nothing is wrong while actively stonewalling her. The tension lies in her growing realization that the system's cruelty requires no villain—just twenty people choosing small silences—and that her own years of "acceptance" made her complicit.

**Form:** Interoffice memoranda with handwritten margin notes, escalating from routine to frantic over six months.
