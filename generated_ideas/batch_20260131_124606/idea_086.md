**Story Idea:**

A ship's navigator aboard a 1950s freighter bound for Sudan discovers that the vessel's cargo manifests have been systematically falsified—not to smuggle contraband, but to smuggle *people out*, and her own father has been running this operation for decades. The story unfolds through her increasingly frantic logbook entries as she realizes the captain knows she's discovered the truth, the ship is being deliberately steered off-course, and the "blocked" radio isn't broken at all. What makes it impossible to put down: she must decide whether to expose an illegal operation that has saved hundreds of lives, knowing her testimony will send her father to prison and doom everyone in the hidden compartments below deck.

**Form:** Ship's navigation logbook with personal annotations in the margins
