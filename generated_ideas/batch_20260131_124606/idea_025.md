**Story Idea:**

A NASA archivist discovers her late grandmother's name in classified 1962 documents—listed as the Soviet engineer who designed the guidance system for a nuclear satellite that never officially existed. The story unfolds through declassified memos, personal letters in Russian she must have translated, and her grandmother's Florida nursing home intake forms that suddenly read as an absurdly modest cover identity. What makes it impossible to put down: every document she uncovers validates another while destroying a childhood memory, until she finds the final file—her own birth certificate, with a redacted father's name and a stamp from an agency that doesn't exist.
