**Story Idea:**

A sleep researcher at a university clinic discovers that one of her prospective study participants—a woman who claims she hasn't slept in eleven years—is telling the truth, and the clinical data reveals something more disturbing: the woman's brain scans show dream-state activity occurring continuously while she's awake, meaning she's been living inside a dream that perfectly mimics reality for over a decade. The story unfolds through the researcher's increasingly erratic lab notes as she becomes obsessed with identifying the exact moment the woman's waking life became indistinguishable from sleep, only to find evidence suggesting the participant enrolled in an identical study once before—in 2013, with a researcher whose notes are word-for-word identical to her own. The final entries should leave unclear whether the researcher has discovered she's the one dreaming, or whether the participant has somehow pulled her into the same endless fiction.

**Form:** Research log with embedded clinical data, sleep study questionnaires, and handwritten marginalia that grows progressively more unhinged.
