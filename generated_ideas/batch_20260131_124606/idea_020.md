**Story Idea:**

A industrial boiler inspector named Frederick discovers that a polymer manufacturing plant has been falsifying safety reports, but the plant manager is his estranged brother Darren, who took him in after their parents died. The story unfolds through Frederick's official inspection logs, which begin as tedious bureaucratic documentation but gradually reveal—through increasingly desperate margin notes, crossed-out sections, and addenda filed at 3 AM—his moral disintegration as he tries to augment minor violations into major ones to justify shutting down the plant without exposing the full scope of his brother's crimes. The final entry is dated three days before a news clipping about an explosion, but we never learn which choice Frederick made, only that he requested a transfer to a different region, citing "completion of all outstanding assignments."
