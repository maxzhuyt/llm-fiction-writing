**Story Idea:**

A census taker in 1920s rural Egypt discovers that a remote village has been reporting the same 847 residents for sixty years—identical names, identical ages, identical occupations—yet when she arrives, the village exists and the people are real, warm, and insist she stay for dinner. The story unfolds through her increasingly erratic field notes, which begin as meticulous bureaucratic documentation but gradually reveal her dawning horror that she recognizes these people, that she has always known them, that her own name appears on the 1862 census in her predecessor's handwriting. The final pages are filled with a single phrase in someone else's script: "She is calm now. She will conduct the next count."
