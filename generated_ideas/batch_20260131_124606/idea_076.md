**Form: Fragmented field notebook entries interspersed with official diplomatic correspondence**

A British translator stationed at a bilateral trade negotiation in 1962 Berlin discovers she can hear the thoughts of anyone whose language she speaks fluently—but only while actively translating their words, creating a half-second delay where she knows what someone will say before they say it. When she realizes the Soviet superintendent of the residence where delegates are housed is planning to defect, she must decide whether to translate his unspoken plea for help during a formal dinner, knowing her own government has strategically positioned her there to identify exactly such opportunities—and exploit them in ways that will get him killed. The notebook entries grow increasingly fragmented as she begins writing in multiple languages simultaneously, trying to find a linguistic space where even her own thoughts can't be surveilled.
