**Story Idea:**

A forensic accountant at a failing zoo discovers that the facility's beloved elderly elephant has been systematically invoiced to seventeen different shell companies over thirty years—technically "sold" repeatedly but never moved, creating a paper trail that leads to the city's most respected philanthropist laundering money through endangered species. The story unfolds through the accountant's increasingly paranoid margin notes on financial documents, Post-its stuck to her cubicle walls, and formal reports she drafts but never submits, as she realizes the zoo's eccentric, beard-obsessed director knows exactly what's happening and has been protecting the elephant by staying complicit. The tension builds as she must decide whether exposing the fraud will save or destroy the animal she's grown to visit every lunch break, and whether some crimes deserve to remain buried in purposefully incomprehensible spreadsheets.

**Primary Form:** Annotated financial documents with handwritten marginalia, interspersed with unsent email drafts.
