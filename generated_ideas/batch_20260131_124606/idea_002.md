**Story Idea:**

A pediatric nurse at a children's hospital has spent fifteen years secretly adjusting medication dosages—always within safe ranges, but deviating from doctor's orders based on her own observations of each child's responses. When a hospital-wide audit reveals the pattern of "errors," she must decide whether to accept quiet termination or expose that her patients consistently recovered faster than the control group. The story unfolds through the transcript of her professional licensing board hearing, where her testimony keeps getting interrupted by parents demanding to speak on her behalf and doctors demanding she be prosecuted.

**Form:** State nursing board disciplinary hearing transcript, with procedural interruptions, redacted patient names, and increasingly chaotic margin notes from the recording clerk.
