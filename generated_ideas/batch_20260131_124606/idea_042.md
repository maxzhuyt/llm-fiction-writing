**Story Idea:**

A competitive baker who has won the annual Royal Castle Baking Championship seven consecutive times receives a letter from the mysterious "L.Oren"—supposedly a reclusive former champion from the 1960s who was erased from all records after a scandal. The letter contains a photograph of a young woman holding a trophy that doesn't exist in any archive, and instructions for a recipe that, when followed, produces a taste the baker can only describe as "heavenly pain." Told through the baker's increasingly obsessive research notebook, the story unravels why the championship's founding family paid to delete fifty years of history, and what really happens to winners who discover the original recipe.
