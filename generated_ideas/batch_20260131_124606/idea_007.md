**Story Idea:**

A Mormon missionary in 1970s Brazil discovers that his companion—Elder Stanley—has been secretly photographing indigenous burial sites along a remote creek, selling the coordinates to artifact traffickers. The story unfolds through the missionary's weekly letters home to his mother, where he must encode his growing horror and moral crisis in language that will pass mission president review, gradually revealing how thoroughly his faith in institutional authority decays as he realizes reporting Stanley through proper church channels has only resulted in his own transfer orders. The letters become increasingly vague about his whereabouts as he goes AWOL to warn the communities himself, the final entry consisting only of a photograph tucked into an envelope—no explanation, no return address.
