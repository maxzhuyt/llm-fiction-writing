**Story Idea:**

A atmospheric research station at the magnetic north pole receives an unusual directive: host a small "informal ceremony" for a delegation that doesn't appear on any government roster. The station's sole meteorologist, increasingly grim about what she's observing in the ice cores, realizes the visitors aren't there to honor scientific achievement—they're there to witness her sign a nondisclosure pact about climate data that would destabilize markets if released. The story unfolds through her research log entries, which begin as dry statistical observations but gradually reveal her plan to encode the suppressed findings within the "boring" numbers themselves, knowing some future knowledgeable reader will crack the pattern.

**Form:** Research station logbook with embedded data tables
