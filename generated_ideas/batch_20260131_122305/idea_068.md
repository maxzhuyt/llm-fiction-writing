**Form: Maintenance logs from a university dining hall's industrial kitchen**

A night-shift baker at a small college has been documenting increasingly strange occurrences in her yeast cultures—they're growing in patterns that mirror the layout of the campus quad, and each morning she finds evidence someone has been in the kitchen after her shift ends, leaving behind half-eaten plates of food at a table set for two. The logs begin as mundane equipment reports but grow obsessive as she starts staying hidden after clocking out, discovering that a grief-stricken professor has been sleepwalking from his office to this kitchen every night since his wife's death, reenacting their Sunday brunches. The maintenance logs become her private record of a debate with herself: whether to report him and end whatever this ritual is doing for his broken mind, or to keep silently baking the rosemary bread his sleeping hands keep reaching for.
