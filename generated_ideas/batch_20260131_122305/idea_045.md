**Form: Annotated dissertation defense transcript with handwritten marginalia**

A Hungarian graduate student's thesis on medieval stewardship records contains a dangerous discovery: proof that a modern banking dynasty's founding fortune came from a 14th century plague quarantine they deliberately broke, transporting infected grain to rival cities. The transcript captures her committee's increasingly hostile questions as one professor—whose family name appears in her documents—attempts to fail her defense on technical grounds while she realizes the "unsupported claims" he's circling are the only ones she can verify with physical evidence she's hidden. The margins contain her frantic notes as she understands the committee room doors have been locked and campus security isn't answering.
