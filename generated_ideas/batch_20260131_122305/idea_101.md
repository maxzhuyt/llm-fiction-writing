**Form: Performance review documents with handwritten marginalia**

A fish farm supervisor in rural Norway discovers that her facility'sNew hire—a marine biologist from the corporate office—is secretly documenting evidence that their high-yield breeding program is producing salmon with unprecedented problem-solving abilities and what appears to be coordinated behavior. The story unfolds through official HR paperwork, incident reports, and increasingly frantic margin notes as the supervisor must decide whether to bury the findings to protect her community's only employer, or react to what the scientist insists is an emerging collective intelligence in Tank 14. The final document is a termination letter with a date three weeks in the future, annotated in handwriting that isn't the supervisor's.
