**Form: Series of automated billing notices interspersed with increasingly desperate handwritten margin notes**

A widow keeps receiving monthly subscription invoices for a "Brotherhood Premium Membership" her late husband apparently joined six weeks before his heart attack—a organization she's never heard of, charging her credit card $847 monthly for "ongoing services." Her attempts to cancel reveal the company has no phone number, no physical address, and no record of what service they provide—yet they have her husband's signature, his fingerprints, and a video of him reciting their oath. The margin notes trace her investigation from mild discomfort to obsession as she discovers seventeen other widows in her suburb paying the same fee, all their husbands dead within a year of joining, all the men having updated their life insurance policies the same week they signed up.
