**Form: Interleaved hospital intake forms and handwritten margin notes**

A labor and delivery nurse discovers that the contractor renovating the maternity ward is her estranged brother, who she last saw seventeen years ago when she testified against him in court—testimony she now knows was based on their father's lies. He doesn't recognize her (she's changed her name, her face altered by a car accident), and she has seventy-two hours before the renovation ends to decide whether to reveal herself or let him leave believing his entire family abandoned him. The story unfolds through her official patient documentation growing increasingly erratic alongside desperate marginal notes as she tracks his movements through the ward, each form a small battlefield between her professional duty to remain invisible and her growing compulsion to reconcile—complicated when she realizes he's been leaving anonymous gifts at the NICU window, watching the premature infants with an expression she remembers from childhood, back when he promised he'd always protect her.
