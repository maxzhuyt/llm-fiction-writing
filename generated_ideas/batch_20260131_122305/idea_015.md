**Story Idea:**

A court-appointed executor discovers that the deceased—a reclusive shipping magnate—kept a diary written entirely in second person, addressed to "you," describing crimes the executor himself committed but has no memory of. As he follows the diary's dated entries backward through his own life, he finds physical evidence at each location that corresponds perfectly to the dead man's account. The story unfolds through alternating fragments: the diary entries themselves, and the executor's increasingly desperate legal filings attempting to recuse himself from the estate—filings that keep getting rejected because the will specifically names him as the only acceptable proxy, with a clause triggering upon his refusal that would expose everything to his estranged son David.
