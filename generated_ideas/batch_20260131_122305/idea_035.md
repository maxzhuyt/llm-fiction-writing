**Story Idea:**

A corporate archivist documenting a tech merger discovers that her company's founder—long celebrated as a visionary—systematically erased his female co-founder from every record, photograph, and patent filing in 1987. The story unfolds through her research log as she pieces together the evidence, but the tension escalates when she realizes the erased woman is still alive, working as a night-shift janitor in the very building where the cleanup of her legacy occurred. The archivist must decide whether to send her findings to the board before the merger completes—knowing the revelation will tank the deal and cost thousands of jobs, including her own—or leave history untouched.
