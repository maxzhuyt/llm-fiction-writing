**Form: Inspection report with handwritten marginalia**

A methane leak inspector for a lunar mining colony files her routine safety assessment of Della Annex, a remote extraction facility—but her official findings contradict the increasingly frantic personal notes she scribbles in the margins, documenting workers who don't appear on any roster, equipment that predates the colony's founding by decades, and her growing suspicion that the "harmless" atmospheric readings are being falsified to sustain something living in the deep shafts. The tension emerges from the widening gap between her bureaucratic language ("within acceptable parameters") and her private terror ("they know I've seen the breathing"), as she realizes the report itself may be the only record of her existence. The final page contains only the official stamp of approval—signed in her handwriting, dated three weeks after her last margin note.
