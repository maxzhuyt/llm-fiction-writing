**Form:** Municipal incident reports interspersed with handwritten margin notes

**Story Idea:** A junior building inspector in a dying rust belt town discovers that the condemned brick factory at the edge of downtown has been quietly operating at night—producing nothing, employing no one on any official record, yet showing increasing electrical usage every month. Her incident reports keep getting "lost" by the municipal office, so she starts keeping her own copies, annotating them with observations: workers she photographs don't appear in the developed images; the factory's output dock faces a wall; her supervisor's signature has developed a subtle wrongness, like a word repeated until it loses meaning. The reports span three months and stop abruptly mid-sentence, but the final margin note—in handwriting that almost resembles hers—reads: "She finally ceased asking questions. The night shift welcomed her. We always need attentive ones."
