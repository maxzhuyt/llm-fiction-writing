**Form: Annotated rental application, with handwritten marginalia from two competing landlords**

A recently widowed marine biologist applies to rent a houseboat in a Florida keys community, unaware that the vessel's previous tenant—a lecturer who vanished mid-semester—left behind research suggesting the local manatee population is being systematically poisoned by a flotation device manufacturer. The application passes between two landlords: one desperate to fill the vacancy before investigators connect the property to the disappearance, the other (the missing man's estranged brother) who keeps adding cryptic warnings in the margins, trying to save the applicant without exposing his own role in covering up what happened. The story unfolds entirely through the bureaucratic document—credit checks, references, pet policies—while the handwritten notes between the landlords escalate from passive-aggressive to threatening to pleading, revealing that the applicant's dead husband was the company's chief environmental officer.
