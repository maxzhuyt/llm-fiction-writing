**Form: Annotated maintenance log from a luxury hotel's engineering department**

The chief engineer at the historic Zion Grand Hotel has been documenting increasingly strange "configuration errors" in the building's automated systems—fountains activating at 3 AM in precise sequences, audio from decades-old guest calls bleeding through modern intercoms, elevator patterns that seem to be counting down to something. As she cross-references the anomalies with the hotel's archived guest registries, she realizes the glitches correspond exactly to the movements of a diplomat who died in Room 1147 in 1962, and the countdown will complete during next week's civic preservation gala attended by his now-elderly enemies. Her margin notes shift from professional troubleshooting to desperate warnings that her supervisors keep dismissing as "hardware issues," while the building itself seems to be taking precautions she never programmed.
