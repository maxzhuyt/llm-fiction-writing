**Form: Handwritten field notebook with increasingly erratic margins**

A wildlife biologist studying monarch butterfly migration patterns at their Mexican wintering grounds notices that this year's population has arrived with wing scales arranged in statistically impossible geometric formations—patterns that, when photographed and overlaid, form topographic coordinates. The coordinates lead to a limestone cave system where she discovers seventeen previous researchers' notebooks spanning 140 years, all documenting the same phenomenon, all ending mid-sentence on the same calendar date: tomorrow. Her own scientific training wars with the evidence before her as she realizes the butterflies aren't navigating *to* something—they're a distributed warning system, and she must decide whether to528444follow her predecessors into the cave or become the first observer to break the cycle by publishing the coordinates and letting the world see what the swarm has been guarding.
