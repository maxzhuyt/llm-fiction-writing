**Form: Annotated deportation case file, with increasingly desperate marginalia**

A immigration judge discovers that the asylum seeker before her—a coffee farmer from Guatemala facing gang-related death threats—is the biological son she placed for adoption thirty-one years ago, a fact she pieces together from testimony details that match the birth father she never named on any document. The case file becomes a palimpsest: her official notations growing cramped and erratic alongside the typed transcript, as she realizes recusal would transfer him to a judge known for denials, while ruling in his favor could expose the connection and void the decision entirely. The story traces three days of hearings through her annotations, which shift from professional to maternal to something like prayer, culminating in a procedural maneuver so ethically ambiguous that even she cannot determine if she saved him or damned her own integrity permanently.
