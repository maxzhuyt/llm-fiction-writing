A mid-level bureaucrat at a aerospace company discovers that her department's "velocity optimization models" are actually calculating something far stranger—the precise trajectories needed for objects to fall from orbit onto specific human targets, disguised as satellite debris. The story unfolds through her increasingly paranoid annotations on routine HR questionnaires and productivity reports, as she tries to document evidence while appearing to be a model employee. The tension coils around a single question: the curved path she's now calculated for the next "accidental" debris strike terminates at her own desk.
