**Form: Maintenance logs from a orbital debris removal station**

A sanitation technician on a space junk collection platform discovers that one piece of "debris" her robotic arms keep grabbing is actually a tiny shrine—a ceramic figure, moisture-sealed photos, children's drawings—that someone on Earth keeps launching into orbit, again and again, despite the expense. Her logs begin as routine truncation reports but evolve into obsessive investigation: who is doing this, and why do they need these objects to touch the edge of space? When she finally identifies the sender and learns the shrine is for a daughter who died believing she'd become a star, she must decide whether to let the next launch pass through her buffer zone—violating every regulation that keeps the skies safe for living satellites.
