**Form: Series of intercepted diplomatic cables with handwritten marginalia**

A mid-level Egyptian antiquities official discovers that the "robber" who has been smuggling artifacts out of Cairo for decades is actually a redundant position—three different intelligence agencies have each been running the same fictional smuggler as cover for their own operations, none aware of the others. When she attempts to resign from the investigation, her superiors inform her that she herself has been listed as the smuggler's primary contact in all three agencies' files since before she was born. The cables document her increasingly desperate attempts to prove her own existence as separate from the cover identity, while the marginalia—in her own handwriting, which she doesn't remember writing—keep correcting her assertions.
