**Form: Interrogation transcript with increasingly frantic marginal annotations by the reviewing officer**

A Kentucky bridge inspector, dismissed as an invalid after a crane accident left him with "unreliable" perception, sits in federal custody insisting that the Babylon River crossing has been *replaced*—not damaged, not repaired, but substituted entirely overnight with a structure that's molecularly explosive, designed to detonate under specific resonance frequencies. The interrogation transcript shows agents dismissing him as drunk or delusional, but the reviewing officer's handwritten notes in the margins grow increasingly urgent as she cross-references his claims with classified seismic reports. The final pages are missing, replaced by a single typed addendum: "Interview subject's concerns addressed. Bridge inspection schedule remains unchanged. Officer [REDACTED] has taken administrative leave."
