**Form: Annotated field notebook of a linguistic anthropologist, with increasingly frantic marginalia**

Dr. Lena Marchetti has spent three years decoding the ceremonial language of a dying Protestant sect in the Louisiana bayou, becoming so fluent in their dialect that she dreams in it. Her notebook documents the slow realization that the sect's elaborate funeral chants aren't prayers—they're instructions, and she's been unknowingly reciting the final verses needed to complete a ritual the congregation has been building toward for 200 years. The entries grow desperate as she tries to redo her translations, hoping she's wrong, while the elderly parishioners watch her with patient, knowing smiles, and her own handwriting in the margins begins responding to her questions in a script she doesn't remember learning.
