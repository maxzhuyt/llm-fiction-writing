**Story Idea:** A Methodist archivist cataloging donated papers from a demolished fort discovers that her own grandmother—who she'd been told died in 1952—appears in photographs dated through 1987, posing beside the same silver-haired military officer across four decades, neither of them visibly aging. Her investigation reveals a comet-observation program that wasn't tracking celestial objects at all, but rather monitoring "frequency events" in a specific bloodline—her bloodline. The resistance she encounters isn't violent or conspiratorial; it's worse: elderly relatives who gently, exhaustedly explain they've been waiting for her to find out, because now it's her turn to choose, and the choice made her grandmother sick with guilt for thirty-five years.
