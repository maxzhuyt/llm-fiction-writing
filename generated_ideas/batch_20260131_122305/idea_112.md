**Form: Annotated field notes from a 1962 Soviet botanical expedition, with increasingly frantic marginalia**

A disgraced ethnobotanist is sent to catalog medicinal plants in a restricted Siberian valley where an uncontacted community has achieved impossible longevity—but her scientific documentation slowly reveals that the "herbal remedies" require a rotating human sacrifice from within the community, and the elders have been waiting decades for an outsider to break the cycle. The tension emerges through her clinical notes growing more personal as she realizes the villagers' overwhelming hospitality has a deadline, while her radio remains mysteriously broken and the single mountain pass grows impassable with early snow. The final entries are written in a hand that isn't hers.
