**Form: Annotated chess notation from a 1987 correspondence match, with increasingly desperate marginalia**

A disgraced Soviet chess grandmaster, exiled to a remote Kazakh observatory, begins a postal chess game with an unknown opponent using the prefix "SANTIAGO-7" as a return address. His analytical notes reveal growing obsession: the opponent's moves implicitly reference classified satellite trajectories he worked on before his fall from grace, and each captured pawn corresponds to the death date of a former colleague. The notations deteriorate from precise Informator symbols into frantic questions—is he being warned, blamed, or recruited?—until the final entry, mid-game, consists only of coordinates and the words "radius confirmed, am within halo, please advise if this constitutes checkmate or zugzwang."
