**Form: Series of increasingly frantic sticky notes left on a breakfast tray**

A live-in caregiver for a wealthy, bedridden patriarch discovers that her employer has been systematically poisoning his own adult children during their Sunday breakfast visits—and that she's been the unwitting delivery mechanism for eighteen months. The story unfolds through the notes she leaves on his meal trays as she tries to confirm her suspicions without alerting him, each message maintaining the fiction of dutiful service while probing for confession. The tension becomes unbearable when she realizes the old man has been reading her growing awareness in the notes all along, and tomorrow's breakfast tray arrives in her quarters with a note in his handwriting: "You've always been like a daughter to me."
