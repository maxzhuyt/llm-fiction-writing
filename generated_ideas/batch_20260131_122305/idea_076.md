**Story Idea:**

A woman discovers that her late husband's will contains a clause making his substantial life insurance "payable upon recognition"—but recognition of what, and by whom, the document never specifies. Presented as a series of increasingly desperate letters between the widow, her husband's estranged brother, and a claims adjuster who seems to know more than she's saying, the story follows the widow as she unravels a brutally simple truth: her husband had been living a second life, and someone from that life must acknowledge his death before anyone can collect. The final letter reveals that the widow herself is the one who must be "recognized"—she was never legally married at all.
