**Form: Annotated rejection letters from a health insurance appeals department, with handwritten marginalia**

A claims processor at a massive health insurer begins leaving anonymous notes in denial letters—tiny hints about which specific phrases will unlock approval on appeal. When a investigator starts tracking the pattern, the processor realizes one of the helped claimants has died anyway, and the family is now using her own coded language to expose the company's denial algorithms. The story unfolds through the official letters, their forbidden annotations, the investigator's increasingly paranoid memos, and finally, a single handwritten note that reveals the processor's daughter was once denied coverage for the same procedure she's now being fired for approving.
