**Form: Annotated margin notes in a secondhand manga volume, passed between two readers over several years**

A nervous archivist at a Kyoto shrine discovers someone has been responding to her penciled margin notes in a used manga she bought online—observations about the story that slowly become personal confessions. The mysterious respondent seems to know impossible details about her life, and the timestamps of their notes suggest they're writing from 2019, three years before she purchased the book. When she finally truncates her half of the correspondence out of fear, a final note appears in unfamiliar handwriting: "You stopped talking to me. That's why I had to find another way to remind you."
