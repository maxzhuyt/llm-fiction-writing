**Form: Series of handwritten coaching notes left in a high school locker**

A veteran wrestling coach discovers his star athlete is deliberately losing matches in a specific pattern—throwing bouts only against opponents from wealthy families. The notes begin as standard technique corrections but evolve into increasingly desperate attempts to understand why Martinez, a kid from the poorest part of town, would sabotage his only shot at a scholarship. The coach's tone shifts from frustration to horror as he realizes the boy isn't being bribed but is instead executing a steady, methodical blackmail scheme against parents whose sons he's witnessed doing something bloody and criminal at the lodge outside town—and that Martinez has been leaving these notes for the coach to find posthumously, as insurance.
