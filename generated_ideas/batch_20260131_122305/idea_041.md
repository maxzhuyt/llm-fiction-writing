**Form: Transcripts of a competitive reality TV show's unaired footage, interspersed with legal depositions**

A documentary crew filming a sailing competition reality show captures footage of the lead scorer—a beloved Olympic athlete—committing what appears to be a minor act of sabotage against a rival's boat. The network buries the footage, but when the rival drowns in the subsequent race, a production assistant leaks the tapes, and the transcripts reveal that multiple crew members witnessed the tampering and said nothing, each assuming someone else would speak up. The depositions slowly expose how the production company's lawyers coached everyone to frame the death as weather-related, until one sound engineer's testimony contradicts the official timeline by exactly seventeen minutes—the length of an "untouched" tape that supposedly doesn't exist.
