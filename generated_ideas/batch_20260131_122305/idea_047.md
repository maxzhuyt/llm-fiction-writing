**Form:** Quarantine inspection logs from a suburban community checkpoint, with handwritten margin notes

**Story Idea:** In 2031, a bacterial outbreak has divided American suburbs into "clean" and "contaminated" zones, with checkpoint inspectors controlling all movement within a five-mile radius. Inspector Paul Okonkwo has twice falsified clearance papers for a Kurdish family hiding their infected grandmother in a kitchen pantry—not out of sympathy, but because the grandmother once saved his daughter's life during the initial outbreak chaos. His logs read as models of bureaucratic compliance, but his margin notes reveal he's tracking a pattern: every family he's quietly passed through has vanished exactly eleven days later, and he's beginning to suspect the "clean" zone isn't processing refugees—it's harvesting them.
