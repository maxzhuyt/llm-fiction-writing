**Form: Disciplinary hearing transcript with handwritten marginalia**

A building inspector in 1950s Melbourne discovers that a prestigious girls' institution has been systematically falsifying structural reports—not to save money, but to conceal a network of hidden rooms whose purpose she cannot determine. The transcript records her testimony before a review board clearly more interested in burying her findings than investigating them, while her desperate annotations in the margins document what she's piecing together in real-time: the board members themselves were all former students. The story becomes impossible to put down because we're watching her realize, line by line, that she's not exposing a conspiracy but being auditioned for one.
