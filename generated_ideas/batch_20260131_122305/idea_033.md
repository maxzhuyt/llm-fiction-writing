**Form: Internal corporate incident report with handwritten margin notes**

A nuclear certification inspector discovers that the skeleton crew running a failing power plant's night shift has been falsifying safety reports for three years—not out of negligence, but because they've been anonymously blackmailed by someone who knows each worker's most shameful secret. The inspector, assigned to rubber-stamp the plant's renewal, realizes the blackmailer's demands have actually *prevented* two potential meltdowns by forcing specific protocol violations that compensated for design flaws the company buried in 1987. Now she must decide whether to expose a criminal conspiracy that's been keeping her city alive, or certify a plant that will kill thousands the moment the blackmailer stops.
