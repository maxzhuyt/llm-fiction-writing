**Story Idea:**

A veterinary technician at an exotic animal sanctuary discovers that the facility's mongoose breeding program is actually a front for an experimental neurostimulation project—the animals are being fitted with cranial implants before being sold to private military contractors. The story unfolds through her mandatory "patient care logs," which begin as routine medical documentation but gradually transform into encoded warnings as she realizes her supervisor is reading them, then into desperate appeals when she learns the program's "termination protocol" applies to staff who ask too many questions. The final entry is written by someone else entirely, blandly noting her "transfer to the Lima facility"—a location that doesn't exist in any company directory.
