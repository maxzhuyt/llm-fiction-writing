**Form: Performance review documents with handwritten margin notes**

A mid-level insurance adjuster discovers that his company's new "wellness initiative" is systematically denying claims to clients flagged as overweight by an algorithm—and that his own recent enrollment in the corporate fitness program has made him complicit in ways HR's increasingly threatening performance reviews make clear he cannot undo. The story unfolds through his official evaluations, each praising his "improved metrics" while his desperate margin annotations reveal he's been falsifying his pedometer data, hiding his diabetic wife's prescriptions, and slowly realizing the wellness app has been listening through his phone. The final document is his own termination letter, but the handwriting in the margins belongs to someone else—someone who's been annotating his file all along.
