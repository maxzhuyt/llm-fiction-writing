**Form: Series of veterinary field notes with increasingly personal marginalia**

A traveling camel veterinarian working the drought-stricken Sahel region discovers that a chronic wasting disease killing herds across three countries isn't natural—the symptoms match an experimental growth hormone that a European agricultural company tested and abandoned in the 1980s, now leaching from a buried waste shaft into groundwater. Her field notes begin as clinical observations but grow desperate as she realizes the company's current "humanitarian livestock aid" program is actually a cover operation to quietly buy out affected land before the contamination becomes public. The story becomes impossible to put down because she's documenting evidence that keeps disappearing from her files, her local contacts keep relocating without explanation, and her increasingly paranoid marginalia—crossed out, rewritten, coded—suggest she knows someone on her own veterinary team is reporting her movements.
