**Form: Series of automated smart-home device logs with handwritten margin notes**

A recently widowed woman discovers her late husband spent their final anniversary secretly programming their home's AI system to release pre-recorded messages, unlock hidden compartments, and trigger small domestic surprises across the next decade—but three months in, the smooth sequence of revelations begins deviating from his notes in ways that suggest either a malfunction or that he anticipated her growing independence and built in responses to choices he couldn't have predicted. The urgency mounts as she realizes the system is running out of memory, forcing her to choose between letting the remaining messages play out of order immediately or preserving them at the cost of never knowing what triggers each one. The margin notes shift from her cataloging his gifts to arguing with a man who cannot answer, until she begins writing back as if he could.
