**Form: Interleaved hospice intake forms and handwritten margin notes**

A hospital administrator processing terminal cancer patients discovers that her facility's intake questionnaire—unchanged since 1987—contains a question on page 47 that no one remembers adding, asking patients to name "the person you wronged most completely." She begins cross-referencing the answers against the timing of deaths and finds an impossible pattern: patients who leave it blank die on schedule, but those who answer it survive exactly long enough for one final interaction with the named person, whether that's three days or three years. When her own mother is admitted and grips the pen over that question, the administrator must decide whether to tell her about the pattern—knowing her mother will certainly write *her* name.
