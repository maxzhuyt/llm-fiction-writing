**Form: Annotated trial transcript with handwritten marginalia**

A court stenographer in 1950s Moscow discovers she's been unconsciously encoding messages in her transcripts—words she doesn't remember typing that, when extracted, form coherent intelligence reports about the very defendant she's recording. The transcript shows the treason trial of a naive young botanist accused of "cosmopolitan" science, but the stenographer's increasingly frantic marginal notes reveal her dawning horror as she finds the hidden text and realizes either she's been hypnotically programmed as a spy, or someone is gaslighting her into a confession. The disparity between the official court record and her private annotations creates two parallel narratives racing toward the same question: if she reports the anomaly, does she save herself or condemn herself?
