**Form: Interoffice memos between pension fund administrators, with handwritten marginalia**

A mousey actuary at a state pension fund discovers that her agency has been running an illegal internal lottery for decades—employees bet on which retirees will die before exhausting their benefits, and the winner each quarter gets a cash bonus drawn from the fund itself. The memos she uncovers show the practice dates back to 1987 and includes the current director, but the marginalia reveals something worse: someone has been nudging the odds, and the handwriting matches her own dead mother's personnel file. She has four days before the quarterly "drawing" to decide whether to expose the scheme or claim what she's now realized is her inheritance.
