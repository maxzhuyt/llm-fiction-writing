**Story Idea:**

A neuropsychologist administering cognitive tests to retired rugby players discovers that one subject—a former Ukrainian refugee who became a national sports hero—is faking his concussion symptoms. Through the clinical transcript of their sessions, she realizes he's deliberately failing tests to qualify for a disability settlement, not for money, but to fund his slowly dying wife's experimental treatment that insurance won't cover. The form is her official evaluation report, but her handwritten marginalia tells the real story: her growing complicity as she must decide whether to document what she's actually observing or what he needs her to see. The tension lives in the gap between her typed clinical language and her increasingly desperate penciled notes, until the final page where both voices merge into a single falsified conclusion.
