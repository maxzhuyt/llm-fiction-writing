**Form:** A series of increasingly frantic diplomatic cables between the U.S. Embassy in Rabat and the State Department, interspersed with handwritten margin notes from a junior analyst who notices what her superiors miss.

**Story Idea:** When American figure skater Elena Voss defects *to* Morocco during a 1987 exhibition tour—not from the Eastern Bloc, but voluntarily abandoning the U.S.—the embassy scrambles to decode her motives before the story breaks internationally. The junior analyst assigned to compile Elena's file discovers that three other American athletes have made similar quiet exits to non-aligned nations over eighteen months, all after competing in the same annual invitational in Vienna. As the analyst's margin notes grow more urgent and her superiors grow more dismissive, the cables reveal she's stumbled onto something the State Department already knows about—and her final note, scrawled in different handwriting, simply reads: "Volunteered for Morocco reassignment. File closed."
