**Form: Annotated auction catalog from a 1987 estate sale**

A deceased gothic novelist's personal effects are being sold, and the catalog entries—dry descriptions of furniture, manuscripts, and curiosities—have been annotated in the margins by two competing bidders who gradually realize they're both former lovers of the dead author, both wrote to her under pseudonyms for decades believing themselves her sole confidant, and both appear as composite villains in her final, unpublished manuscript listed as Lot 247. The annotations begin as snide one-upmanship, escalate into accusations about who truly knew her, and culminate in the discovery that a third annotator has been responding all along—in handwriting that matches the deceased's.
