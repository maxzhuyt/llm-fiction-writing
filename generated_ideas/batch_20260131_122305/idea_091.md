**Form: Freshman orientation welcome packet with increasingly frantic handwritten marginalia**

The glossy brochure for Reid College promises "seamless integration into academic life," but the handwritten notes in the margins—left by a previous owner—tell a different story: warnings about which dining hall to avoid after dinner service, instructions for a "leap" that must be performed at the timber bridge on the quad's north edge, and cryptic references to "the assembly" that occurs when the campus bell system emits a particular buzz at 3:47 AM. The annotations grow more desperate as the packet progresses, the handwriting deteriorating, until the final page contains only: "They know you're reading this. Mild interest is enough. Don't attend the national showcase." The current reader—a new freshman—has already RSVP'd yes.
