**Form: Interleaved field notes from two geographers, 1987**

A USGS cartographer mapping electrical grid vulnerabilities along the Arkansas-Missouri border discovers that her predecessor's surveys contain deliberate errors—tiny fortress-shaped symbols marking locations that don't exist. When she tracks down the retired surveyor, now in a Baldwin County nursing home, he insists the symbols mark places that *will* exist, coordinates he received in recurring dreams from his drowned twin brother. Her scientific field notes gradually become contaminated by his prophetic logic as she visits each site and finds fresh construction foundations at every one—and the final symbol sits precisely where her motel room stands tonight.
