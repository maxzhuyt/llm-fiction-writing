**Form: Recovered voice memos from a smartphone, transcribed as evidence**

A traveling medical equipment saleswoman, known in her territory for her humble demeanor and encyclopedic knowledge of injectable insulin delivery systems, discovers that the glucose measurement devices her company manufactures have been systematically calibrated to distort readings for patients in low-income zip codes—not through malice, but through an algorithm that "optimizes" replacement part sales. Her voice memos begin as rehearsals for a whistleblower complaint, but as she drives her rural route through Tyler County, they transform into something stranger: confessions to her diabetic mother, who died last spring using the same devices, about whether knowing the truth would have saved her or simply cracked the faith that kept her taking her medication at all.
