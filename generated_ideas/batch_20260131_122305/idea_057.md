**Form:** Maintenance logs from a deep-space relay station, interspersed with personal audio transcriptions

**Story Idea:** A solo maintenance technician on a gravitational wave detection array at the edge of the solar system discovers her station's circuits are receiving a consistent, mathematically structured signal—one that matches a message her grandfather, a disgraced SETI researcher, claimed to have intercepted forty years ago before being professionally destroyed for "fabricating" evidence. As she secretly documents the signal while filing bland official reports that disclaim anything unusual, she realizes the transmission contains what appears to be a factorial counting sequence that her grandfather's notes predicted would arrive precisely at the millennium's quarter-mark. The logs grow increasingly fragmented as she must choose between the confidentiality protocols that protect her career and the bizarre possibility that vindicating a dead man's legacy might be humanity's first contact—all while someone at mission control has noticed her power consumption anomalies and is asking questions.
