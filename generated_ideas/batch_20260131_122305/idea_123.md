**Form: Interleaved email correspondence and medical board hearing transcript**

A Chinese-American neurology resident at a Detroit teaching hospital discovers that her supervising physician has been systematically misdiagnosing epilepsy in Black patients from the Ferguson precinct, labeling their seizures as drug-related to avoid the paperwork of chronic care—and she's been unknowingly co-signing his charts for eleven months. The story unfolds through her increasingly desperate emails to the hospital's ethics board, their bureaucratic non-responses, and the transcript of the hearing where she must choose between her career and testimony that will expose her own complicity. What makes it impossible to put down: she cannot prove she didn't know, and the one patient who could exonerate her died last week from an "unrelated" fall.
