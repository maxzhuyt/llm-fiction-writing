**Form: Insurance claim denial letters interspersed with handwritten appeals**

A Black graduate student in 1950s Chicago files repeated insurance claims for her asthma medication, each denial revealing the company's covert "negro indices"—actuarial tables that systematically reject coverage for African American policyholders. As her appeals grow more desperate and her health deteriorates, she begins documenting the exposed racist infrastructure with meticulous precision, transforming her correspondence into evidence for a coalition of civil rights attorneys. The insurance adjuster processing her claims, a white woman named Geoff's widow who took the job after her husband's suicide, starts smuggling internal memos underneath her official denials—and the reader watches both women risk everything through documents that were never meant to be read together.
