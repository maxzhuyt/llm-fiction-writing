**Story Idea:**

A Vatican archivist discovers that for 400 years, her office has been systematically "encrypting" evidence of the Church's persecution of a specific bloodline—not destroying it, but encoding it into the backgrounds of approved religious murals across Europe. The story unfolds through her increasingly paranoid research log as she realizes the current Pope's surgical scars match the distinctive birthmarks documented in the oldest files, and that she's been assigned this discovery deliberately. The question driving the narrative: is she meant to expose this or become the next layer of the cover-up?
