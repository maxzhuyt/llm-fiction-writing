**Form: Annotated evidence log from a cold case review**

A retired detective revisits the 1987 disappearance of a child from an upstairs bedroom—a case that destroyed his marriage and career—after DNA verification links it to six other vanishings he never knew existed. As he compiles the log, his annotations grow increasingly unhinged; he's discovering that the original lead investigator (his own mentor, now dead) deliberately barred connections between cases, and the padding in the evidence boxes contains documents that were supposed to have been destroyed. The log entries begin addressing someone directly—"You're reading this, aren't you?"—suggesting he knows his review has attracted attention from whoever his mentor was protecting, and he's using the official record as a proxy confession, a dead man's switch, a hand reaching out from what he expects will be his own imminent disappearance.
