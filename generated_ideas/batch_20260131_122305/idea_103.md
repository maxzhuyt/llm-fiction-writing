**Story Idea:**

A family court mediator discovers that the custody case on her desk involves her own biological daughter—a toddler she placed for closed adoption three years ago—and the adoptive parents are now divorcing acrimoniously, each citing the other as unfit. The story unfolds through her official case notes, which begin as crisp bureaucratic documentation but gradually fracture as she struggles to remain professionally invisible while watching strangers decide the fate of the child she gave up so that child could thrive. She has 72 hours to either recuse herself and explain why, or render a placement recommendation that will haunt her forever.
