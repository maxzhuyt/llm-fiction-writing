**Form: Interleaved municipal records and personal diary entries**

A city archivist discovers that her predecessor spent thirty years subtly altering the street directory—renaming roads, erasing blocks, redirecting the layout of an entire neighborhood that census records insist houses 3,000 people but that no GPS can locate and no bus route serves. Her investigation reveals the neighborhood exists in a bureaucratic hollow: legally present, practically invisible, its residents systematically "deported" from official existence after a 1970s surgical trial left them with a condition the county refuses to acknowledge. As she works to restore their visibility, she realizes her own mother's maiden name appears on the original resident list—and her family's insistence that they've "always" lived across town begins to feel less like memory and more like a story they were given to replace the one that was taken.
