**Form: Annotated inheritance inventory with handwritten marginalia**

A Hungarian-American woman receives a shelf-by-shelf catalog of her estranged grandmother's waterfront antique shop in Nova Scotia, each item annotated by the elderly woman herself before her death—but the notes gradually reveal that the "antiques" are actually salvaged possessions from a 1956 refugee ship that sank, and grandmother has been tracking down survivors' families for decades, returning items while keeping meticulous graphs of a debt she believes she owes. The granddaughter, reading the inventory, realizes one annotation references her own father—listed not as family, but as "passenger 31, unresolved"—and the marina where the shop stands is built directly over the wreck site.
