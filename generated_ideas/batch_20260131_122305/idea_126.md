**Form: Series of increasingly frantic internal memos from a cruise ship's medical officer**

A luxury liner's doctor notices that passengers who attend the onboard mixology classes are developing identical, beatific smiles and an obsessive habit of stirring their drinks clockwise—always clockwise. Her infection control training screams contamination, but blood work shows nothing except an unidentifiable compound that seems to inhibit stress hormones entirely. As the ship passes through the gate of Gibraltar with no scheduled port for eleven days, she realizes the bartender—a man the crew manifest lists as "Matthew Trabal," though no one remembers hiring him—has stopped attending his own classes, because he no longer needs to: the passengers have started teaching each other.
