**Form: Series of handwritten letters between two sisters, with increasingly long gaps between responses**

A woman serving as executor of her estranged mother's estate discovers a fossil collection that doesn't match any known species—and her mother's meticulous scientific journals documenting their excavation from a site that, according to all geological records, has never been dug. When she reaches out to her paleontologist sister for help, the sister's replies grow evasive, then frightened, then stop entirely after she writes: "I showed Dr. Hendricks the photos. He went pure white and asked where Mom is buried." The final letter in the collection is from neither sister—it's from their mother, dated three weeks after her funeral, commending them for finding her "opening" and providing coordinates to a Wyoming canyon with the instruction: "Come before the thaw. Bring the teeth. Don't tell anyone you're awake now."
