**Form: Insurance claim denial letters with handwritten marginalia**

A claims adjuster for a supernatural insurance firm must deny coverage to a policyholder whose soul was stolen by a minor deity, citing a "pre-existing spiritual vulnerability" clause—but the marginalia reveal she's secretly helping the client rebuild their case because the same deity took her daughter three years ago. Each letter becomes more technically absurd in its denials while the handwritten notes grow increasingly desperate, mapping the geometry of a ritual that requires the insurer's official seal to work. The final document is an approval letter for a policy that doesn't exist, signed in blood, with a child's handwriting in the margin: "Mom, I can see you now."
