**Story Idea:**

A forensic accountant for a struggling Arizona sheep ranch discovers that the operation has been paying a "J. Pascal" on its payroll since 1847—174 years of uninterrupted biweekly checks, all cashed. Told through her increasingly unhinged expense reports and audit memos to corporate, she traces the payments through Civil War scrip, territorial bank drafts, and modern direct deposits, each one signed for in the same handwriting. The checks are always cashed in different cities—Toledo, Delaware, the Dakotas—but satellite imagery shows the same figure appearing at the ranch's lambing pool every spring. Her final memo requests guidance on whether to file a 1099 for an employee who may be immortal, divine, or simply the most elaborate multi-generational fraud in American history.
