**Story Idea:**

A customs inspector at a small port begins noticing impossible discrepancies in routine shipments—crates that weigh exactly what they should yet sound hollow, manifests signed by company representatives who died years ago, goods that pass every test but feel somehow *wrong* to handle. She starts keeping an unofficial log, and as her entries grow more paranoid, readers realize she's documenting either an elaborate smuggling operation or her own psychological unraveling—the evidence supports both interpretations equally. The story takes the form of her field notebook interleaved with increasingly terse official memos from supervisors who find her "utilization of departmental resources" concerning, building toward a final inspection where she must open a container she's certain contains something that will resolve everything, or nothing at all.
