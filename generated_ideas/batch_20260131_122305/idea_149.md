**Form: Series of increasingly frantic internal memos from a pharmaceutical company's legal department**

A junior analyst discovers that the company's blockbuster pneumonia drug doesn't actually work—the successful clinical trials resulted from a data leak that allowed researchers to unconsciously cherry-pick patients. As she tries to withdraw the findings through proper channels, each memo she sends gets "conveniently" rerouted, and colleagues who help her begin experiencing career-ending accidents. The final memo, addressed to the FDA, is found in her apartment after her death, annotated in three different handwritings—one of which matches the CEO's, one matches her own, and one belongs to no one currently employed at the company.
