**Story Idea:**

A Vietnamese-American woman receives a water-stained cardboard box from her estranged father's storage unit, containing his meticulous field notes from his years as a USDA onion inspector in rural Oregon—a job she never knew he held during the decade he claimed to be "finding himself." The notes begin as dry agricultural observations but gradually reveal he was documenting something else entirely: the slow, seasonal rhythms of a white farming family who didn't know he was falling profoundly in love with their life, their land, and the idea of belonging somewhere his own family had never let him rest. The story unfolds through his annotated inspection reports, pressed wild onion flowers, and unsent letters to a daughter he was too cautious to burden with his loneliness.
