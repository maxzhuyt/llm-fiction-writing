**Form: Intercepted radio transcripts with handwritten annotations by an unknown analyst**

A fishing boat captain operating out of Porto discovers her vessel has been unknowingly smuggling coded messages embedded in the "goods manifests" she's been paid to deliver between ports—and the messages, once decoded by authorities, reveal assassination coordinates that have already resulted in three deaths. The transcripts capture her increasingly desperate ship-to-shore communications as she tries to identify which crew member is the actual courier, while the analyst's marginalia reveal a second, more chilling investigation: determining whether the captain herself is the loser in an elaborate frame-up or a masterful actor performing innocence. The story becomes impossible to put down because the analyst's notes grow progressively more personal and unhinged, suggesting they recognize something in the captain's voice, until a final annotation—written in different handwriting—simply reads: "Analyst Martinez failed to report for duty. Sunrise search initiated."
