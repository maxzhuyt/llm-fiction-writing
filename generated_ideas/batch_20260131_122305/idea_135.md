**Form: Veterinary intake logs from a rural animal sanctuary, spanning sixty days**

A goat arrives at the sanctuary with worn symbols shaved into its hide—symbols that match unexplained markings found on three missing hikers' backpacks. The elderly sanctuary owner begins documenting the animal's strange behaviors: it stands vertical against fences at 3 AM, it refuses to sleep, it watches the volunteer coordinator with what she describes as "patient hunger." As she cross-references the intake dates with local disappearances going back decades, her clinical notes grow increasingly fragmented, and the final entries are written in handwriting that doesn't match her own.
