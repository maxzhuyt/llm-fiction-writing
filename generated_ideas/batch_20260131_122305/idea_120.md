**Form: Series of increasingly desperate internal memos from a mid-level bureaucrat**

A delegation coordinator at an international climate summit discovers that the Moroccan attaché she's been assigned to chaperone is actually her college roommate—the woman whose identity she's been "borrowing" for fifteen years after a clerical error gave her the other woman's credentials and transformed her from dropout to diplomat. The memos document her attempts to strategically avoid direct contact while managing seating charts, rental car assignments, and coffee service, each near-miss encounter ratcheting tension as the attaché keeps requesting private meetings about an "urgent personal matter." The burnt bridges of her real identity have long since collapsed, and what remains unclear—what makes her spiral through these frantic, self-justifying reports to colleagues who have no idea what they're really reading—is whether the attaché has come to expose her, forgive her, or ask for something far stranger.
