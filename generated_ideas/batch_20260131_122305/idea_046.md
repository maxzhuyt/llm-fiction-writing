**Form: Annotated recipe cards passed down through three generations**

A grandmother's handwritten recipe for "Chicken à la Nicolas" contains increasingly frantic margin notes added over decades—first her daughter's, then her granddaughter's—each documenting how the dish fails catastrophically unless prepared during a full moon. The annotations grow more detailed and theoretical as each woman tries to rationalize why this is happening, until the granddaughter discovers a newspaper clipping tucked behind the card: a 1952 obituary for Nicolas Marchetti, a chef who choked to death at this family's table, with the final line branded into the paper by a burned ring: "He died silent, mid-gulp, and was never properly mourned." The most recent annotation, in handwriting the granddaughter doesn't recognize, reads: "The recipe is not for the chicken."
