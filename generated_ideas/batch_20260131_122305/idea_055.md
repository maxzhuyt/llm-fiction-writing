**Form: Series of handwritten letters between two sisters, with increasingly long gaps between responses**

A Iranian-American chocolatier in Los Angeles discovers that her estranged younger sister has enrolled in a controversial "emotional defect correction" program run by their aunt in Tehran—a program their mother underwent in 1985 and never discussed. As she pieces together her mother's letters from that era (hidden in a recipe box), she realizes the "treatment" involves systematic erasure of ambiguous loyalties and complex affections, replacing them with simplified devotion to family hierarchy. The sister's letters grow shorter, more comforting in tone, stripped of her characteristic sarcasm and questions—and the chocolatier must decide whether to fly to Tehran and risk her green card, or watch her sister's personality dissolve into the same hollow sweetness their mother carried until her death.
