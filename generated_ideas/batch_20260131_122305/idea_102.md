**Form: Handwritten notebook entries interspersed with increasingly frantic marginalia**

A Oxford-trained archivist cataloging a deceased professor's papers discovers that her mentor spent forty years suppressing evidence of a 1962 referendum in a small Welsh mining town—one where residents voted on whether to surrender a child to the flooded cess tunnels beneath the slag mound, and the "yes" votes were unanimous, including the child's parents. As she cross-references names, she realizes the professor was that child, somehow returned, and his recent research grant proposals all involve her hometown's upcoming council election. The notebook begins as scholarly documentation but tapers into her growing worry that she's been groomed for a role in something her rational mind insists cannot be real—yet the names in the 1962 documents include one she recognizes as her grandmother's maiden name, with "COLLATERAL" stamped in red beside it.
