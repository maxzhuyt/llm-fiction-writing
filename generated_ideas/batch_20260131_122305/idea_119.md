**Story Idea:**

A television broadcaster who covered the 1989 Romanian revolution has spent thirty years believing she witnessed a genuine popular uprising, until a dying Securitate officer sends her a microscope slide containing a coded microfilm—evidence that the entire "spontaneous" revolt was orchestrated by a faction within the regime, and that her iconic live reports were themselves part of the operation. The story unfolds through her research notebook as she travels back to Bucharest, intercutting her contemporary investigation with transcripts of her original broadcasts, gradually revealing that the cameraman she'd trusted (and loved) had been feeding her staged footage. The tension builds toward a choice: expose the manipulation and destroy the founding myth of modern Romania, or protect the democracy that grew from the lie—complicated by the discovery that her own father, a Hungarian diplomat she'd believed was stationed elsewhere, appears in the microfilm as an allocator of Western funds to the conspirators.
