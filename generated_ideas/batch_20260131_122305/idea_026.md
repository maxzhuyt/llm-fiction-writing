**Form: Annotated custody evaluation report with handwritten marginalia**

A family court evaluator's official assessment of a bitter divorce proceeding contains increasingly disturbed margin notes as she realizes the "infant" at the center of the case—whom she's never been allowed to meet in person—may not exist at all, yet both parents describe the child in identical, rehearsed detail. The formal typescript recommends standard shared custody arrangements while her handwritten annotations trace her growing suspicion that she's witnessing either a shared delusion or an elaborate insurance fraud, complicated by the fact that hospital birth records do exist. The evaluator must acknowledge in her final addendum that she cannot locate a single person outside the parents who has ever seen the baby, and the last page contains only a phone number for the police and the scrawled question: "Then whose crying did I hear from the bedroom?"
