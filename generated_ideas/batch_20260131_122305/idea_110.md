**Form: Internal affairs investigation transcript**

A veteran NFL referee, weeks from retirement, begins making calls so statistically improbable that gambling syndicates suspect corruption—but the investigation reveals something stranger: she's experiencing detailed premonitions of career-ending injuries before they happen and is making "bad" calls specifically to stop plays that would have paralyzed players. The transcript follows the investigator's uncomfortable realization that every controversial call correlates with a player who, in reviewing the film, was milliseconds from catastrophic contact. The referee refuses to defend herself because she knows how it sounds, and the league must decide whether to expose her gift—destroying her credibility and possibly the ability itself—or quietly allow the "worst ref in football" to finish her final season.
