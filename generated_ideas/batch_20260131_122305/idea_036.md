**Form: Fragmented field notes and personal journal entries**

A wildlife biologist conducting a rabbit population survey in remote Idaho discovers that the colony she's tracking has been methodically avoiding a specific geographic zone—a perfect circle three miles in diameter with no visible features distinguishing it from surrounding terrain. When she finally enters the zone, her GPS fails, her radio reaches no one, and she finds the remains of a research camp from 1987 that was never reported missing. Her notes become increasingly obsessive as she realizes the rabbits aren't avoiding a place; they're avoiding something that returns to that place, and she's now documented proof that someone intended to keep hidden.
