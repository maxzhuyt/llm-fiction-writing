**Form: Series of landlord-tenant portal messages with timestamps**

A property manager for a remote Arctic research station discovers that the "vacancy" in Pod 7 isn't actually empty—previous tenants keep logging maintenance requests from inside, complaining about cold drafts and a persistent knocking, despite the station's records showing the unit sealed since a 1987 incident that's been redacted from official files. As she investigates locally through the portal system, each former tenant's messages grow more fragmented and desperate, until she realizes the timestamps on their complaints are dated *after* their documented deaths—and the newest message is from herself, dated three weeks from now, begging whoever reads it not to open the inset panel behind the heating unit. The constraint she faces: the current overwinter crew is already reporting the knocking, and station protocol requires her to investigate all maintenance requests in person.
