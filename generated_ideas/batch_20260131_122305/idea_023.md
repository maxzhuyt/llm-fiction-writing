**Form: Series of handwritten notes passed between two museum night guards**

A veteran guard at a small-town historical society has spent eleven years on the night shift believing the job was idle busywork—until a new hire points out that the bronze plaque commemorating the town's founding displays a different date each morning, always reverting by the time administrators arrive. As the two guards document the changes through increasingly frantic note exchanges (they work opposite ends of the building, forbidden to abandon their posts), they realize the dates are counting backward toward something, and the plaque's inscription has begun adding names—including, as of last night, the new guard's. The veteran must decide whether to declare what they've witnessed to people who will think them insane, or to prevent whatever is coming by destroying a artifact that the institution's largest donor visits, alone, every month at 3 AM.
