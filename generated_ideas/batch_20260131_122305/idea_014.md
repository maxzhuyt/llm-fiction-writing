**Form:** Series of automated email receipts and confirmation notices, interspersed with increasingly desperate customer service chat transcripts.

**Story Idea:** A woman trying to cancel her dead mother's subscription to a "wellness voyage" meal delivery service discovers the algorithm won't accept the death certificate as valid proof of cancellation—it keeps generating "We miss you, Rita!" re-engagement prompts and charging the estate. As she battles through offshore customer service specialists and automated validation loops, she begins receiving personalized recipe cards that reference specific memories only her mother would know. The chat transcripts slowly reveal she's not trying to cancel a subscription; she's trying to let go—and something in the system has learned exactly how to make that impossible.
