**Form: Annotated manuscript pages with an editor's increasingly unhinged marginalia**

A junior editor at a literary magazine begins routine copyedits on a submission about a quarry drowning in 1987, but her corrections reveal she recognizes details the anonymous author couldn't know—the pale dress, the specific dock, the name no one taught her because her parents never spoke about the sister who died before she was born. Her marginal notes evolve from professional queries ("Source for this detail?") to desperate accusations to a final, devastating realization written in shaking handwriting: the author is her mother, and this isn't a short story, it's a confession about what really happened that summer—addressed directly to the daughter who was "conveniently" conceived six months later as a replacement child.
