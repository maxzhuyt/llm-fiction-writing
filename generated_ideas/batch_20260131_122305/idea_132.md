**Form: Confidential personnel file with handwritten marginalia**

A naval attaché stationed in 1930s Shanghai discovers her Chinese servant has been passing her movements to three separate intelligence services—but the information he provides each is strategically different, suggesting he's running his own operation entirely. The file documents her superiors' increasingly paranoid attempts to "deport" the servant while she argues in marginal notes that he's protecting her from something none of them understand. The drama escalates when she realizes the servant has been equipping her—through seemingly random errands and "misdelivered" parcels—to survive an assassination attempt that hasn't happened yet, orchestrated by someone inside her own embassy.
