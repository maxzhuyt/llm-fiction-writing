**Form: Annotated employee incident report with handwritten marginalia**

A glass factory quality inspector discovers that one production line has been secretly casting defective medical vials for three years—vials now distributed across twelve countries holding insulin, chemotherapy drugs, children's vaccines. The report she's required to file will either destroy the company and her pension or kill an unknowable number of strangers through slow-release contamination. Her supervisor has handed her the blank document with a sandwich and a smile, saying "Take your time, think about your role here," while security logs show someone already deleted the batch tracking data. The story unfolds through her increasingly frantic annotations on the official form—crossing out sanitized language, adding real numbers in margins, arguing with herself about what "accurate" means when accuracy is a death sentence for someone no matter what she writes.
