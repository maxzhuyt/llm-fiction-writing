**Form: Annotated court transcript with handwritten marginalia**

A Native American radio host in 1950s South Dakota discovers that her popular Lakota-language algebra tutoring program—designed to help reservation students pass state exams—has been cited in a federal indictment as "subversive enrichment activity" after an informant claims she's embedding coded resistance messages in her math problems. The transcript follows her contempt hearing, but the real story emerges in her penciled notes in the margins: corrections to the prosecutor's mangled pronunciation of Lakota words, running calculations proving the "codes" are just quadratic formulas, and increasingly detached observations about the judge's habit of smoothing his hair whenever he lies. The final pages are missing from the official record, replaced by a child's homework sheet solving for X, with the answer circled: "Treaty boundaries, 1868."
