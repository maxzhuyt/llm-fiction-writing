**Form: Annotated catalog entries from a 1956 estate auction**

A deceased Austrian diplomat's belongings are being liquidated in Brussels, and the catalog compiler—a junior clerk at the ministry—begins noticing disturbing patterns: the Tibetan prayer wheel contains microfilm, the "decorative stickers" on steamer trunks mark a route through quarantine zones during the 1918 influenza, and the unused terrace furniture was delivered to a Vienna address that hasn't existed since 1943. As she annotates each lot with increasingly frantic marginalia, she realizes the auction itself is a dead drop, the bidders are not collectors, and her predecessor who started this catalog never finished it for reasons the final entries make horrifically clear.
