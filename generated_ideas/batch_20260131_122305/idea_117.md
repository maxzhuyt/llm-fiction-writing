**Form: Handwritten inventory ledger with marginal annotations**

A cooper's apprentice in 1962 Havana is tasked with cataloging the barrel contents of a warehouse seized during nationalization, but her measured notations increasingly give way to frantic marginalia as she realizes the "agricultural equipment" she's documenting is actually components for Soviet missiles—and her supervisor knows she knows. The ledger becomes a covert diary of her impossible calculation: smuggle out evidence to the Americans (making her family hostages to consequence), destroy the records (becoming protector of a regime she despises), or complete the inventory and pretend ignorance while the world edges toward annihilation. The final pages show her handwriting deteriorating, the official entries growing terse, while the margins fill with obsessive drawings of her younger brother's face.
