**Form: Quarterly compliance reports from a state psychiatric facility, 1987-1989**

A mysterious pattern emerges across three years of bureaucratic documentation: every patient diagnosed with schizophrenia in Ward C shows identical improvement during a specific two-week window each autumn, then relapses precisely when the facility rotates its seasonal bedding supplier. The reports grow increasingly frantic as the compliance officer—initially dismissive—begins noticing her own perceptions shifting when she handles the files, her handwriting changing, her entries containing information she doesn't remember writing. The final report is submitted by someone claiming to be her, requesting an audit of a ward that facility records show was permanently closed in 1962.
