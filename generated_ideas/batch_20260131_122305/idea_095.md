**Form:** Performance evaluation reports from a circus school, spanning fifteen years

**Story Idea:** The fictional Instituto Martinez trains children from collapsed Soviet states to become elite aerial artists, and we read the annual evaluations of one student—Yelena—from age seven to twenty-two, written by her increasingly obsessed instructor. The reports begin as dry assessments of rope technique and "professional diligence," but marginalia, crossed-out sentences, and attached incident forms reveal the instructor is systematically isolating Yelena from other students, convincing her that her bent spine makes her unlovable to anyone but him. The final document isn't an evaluation at all—it's a liability waiver for her first solo performance, unsigned, with a handwritten note from the institute's lawyer asking why the instructor was found on the rigging that morning, and where Yelena has gone.
