**Story Idea:**

A career Secret Service agent writes her classified after-action report on the assassination attempt she was supposed to prevent—but didn't—because stopping it would have exposed her decade-long undercover infiltration of a domestic terror cell, and she had exactly four seconds to choose between saving the Vice President's infant granddaughter (the actual target) or preserving an operation that could dismantle the entire network. The report is addressed to the review board determining whether she committed treason or made the only prudent call, but its real audience is her own conscience as she reconstructs the highway motorcade moment by moment, revealing how the cell exploited her psychological profile and turned her greatest strength—patience—into paralysis. The tension coils tighter as readers realize she's writing this from a hospital room, that the baby's fate remains unconfirmed until the final page, and that her commanding officer—the one person who could corroborate her impossible choice—died in the same attack.
