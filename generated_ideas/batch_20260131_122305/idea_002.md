**Form: Intercepted pager messages with handwritten analyst annotations**

A secular Turkish intelligence officer in 1994 Ankara begins receiving pager messages meant for someone else—cryptic references to "the flagship" and "the gyro shipment"—and realizes she's accidentally intercepting communications between a parliament member and figures planning a coup. The messages reveal the conspirators believe *she* is one of them, that "Jessica" is her codename, and that she's already been measured for a role she never agreed to play. As she tries to identify who enrolled her in this plot, the analyst's increasingly frantic margin notes reveal he's fallen in love with her through surveillance and is falsifying reports to protect her—while she remains unaware she has two shadows, not one.
