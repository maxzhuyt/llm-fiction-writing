**Form: Interleaved maintenance logs and personal journal entries**

A boiler technician at a remote Antarctic research station begins noticing impossible playback artifacts in the facility's thermal monitoring system—heat signatures of a person moving through corridors during hours when all twelve crew members are accounted for. His maintenance logs grow increasingly clinical and detached even as his journal entries spiral into obsession, and the reader gradually realizes the timestamps reveal he's been losing hours, sometimes entire shifts, with no memory of where he's been. The story reaches its explosive turn when he reviews security footage to prove his sanity and watches himself methodically sabotaging the heating systems while wearing an expression of serene purpose—and in the video, he's clearly responding to someone just outside the frame, someone whose breath fogs in the cold.
