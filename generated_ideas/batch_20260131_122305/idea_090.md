**Form: Annotated exhibition catalog, with increasingly unhinged curator's notes**

A prestigious museum acquires a collection of handmade copper printing plates from an anonymous 19th-century evangelical press, only for the conservator to discover that the serifs on certain letters encode a second text—a systematic record of children sold through the mission's "education" program. The catalog begins as dry scholarly analysis, but the curator's annotations grow obsessive as she realizes the collector who donated the plates is descended from the mission's founders and sits on the museum's board. Each entry measures another artifact while the footnotes document her deteriorating position: blocked emails, a gaslit performance review, her access badge mysteriously deactivated. The final pages are handwritten additions, smuggled in before the opening gala, addressed directly to whoever reads the catalog next.
