**Form: Series of product recall notices and internal quality assurance memos**

A silicone baby bottle manufacturer discovers their newest "environmentally conscious" line has been leaching a compound that makes infants temporarily invisible to standard baby monitors—a defect they realize only after cross-referencing customer service complaints with a spike in "neglected infant" investigations by child protective services in three states. The QA director must trace how the contamination occurred while the legal team pressures her to frame the recall notice in language that obscures causation. Each document in the sequence reveals another layer: a cost-cutting decision by a buyer sourcing cheaper materials, a suppressed safety rating from an overseas lab, and finally, her own signature on an approval form she doesn't remember signing.
