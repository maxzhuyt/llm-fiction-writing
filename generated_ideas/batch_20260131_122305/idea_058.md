**Form: Rejection letters from a literary magazine, arranged chronologically over eighteen months**

A junior editor at a prestigious quarterly begins sending increasingly unhinged rejection letters to a single persistent submitter, each letter revealing more about the editor's deteriorating marriage, his suspicion that the magazine's founder is embezzling, and his growing obsession with the submitter's recurring character—a nameless bureaucrat trapped in an endless performance review. The submitter never responds except through revised stories, each one incorporating details from the rejection letters that the editor never consciously disclosed. The final document is the editor's resignation letter, addressed not to his employer but to the fictional bureaucrat, begging to be written into the next submission.
