**Form: Annotated auction catalog from a 1987 estate sale**

A deceased Filipino architect who worked for the Marcos regime left behind a collection of antique Ming dynasty pieces—but the catalog's anonymous annotator (revealed through increasingly desperate marginalia to be the architect's daughter) discovers that each acquisition date corresponds exactly to a political disappearance, and the "provenance documentation" her father meticulously kept actually encodes the locations of mass graves. She's bidding against a banker who clearly knows what the documents really contain, and the auction house has a reservation policy that won't release items to anyone who can't prove "legitimate scholarly interest." The annotations begin as clinical art-historical notes and deteriorate into a woman realizing she must publicly destroy her father's reputation—and possibly her family's safety—to recover evidence that dozens of families have spent decades searching for.
