**Form: Fragmented radio transcripts interspersed with handwritten margin notes**

A night-shift emergency dispatcher in a small mining town begins receiving calls from a woman trapped in a collapsed quartz mine—except the mine has been sealed since 1987, and the phone number traces to a disconnected line. Each call reveals information the dispatcher couldn't know: details about her estranged mother's final hours in that same mine thirty years ago. As the transcripts accumulate and the dispatcher's increasingly unhinged annotations fill the margins, she must decide whether to mount an impossible rescue or accept that something down there has been waiting, with terrible intent, for the daughter to finally pick up.
