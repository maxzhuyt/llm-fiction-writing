**Form: Intake assessment reports from a state welfare bureau, interleaved with handwritten margin notes**

A caseworker processing her grandfather's application for extended care discovers his file has been flagged "ineligible—see 1971 parameter"—a classification code that doesn't exist in any manual. As she digs through archived intake reports, she finds dozens of elderly applicants across three decades who share this code, all from the same rural county, none of whom appear in death records or transfer documentation. The narrative unfolds through her increasingly frantic official queries and the terse, evasive responses from regional supervisors, while her grandfather's handwritten notes in the margins of his own paperwork suggest he knows exactly what the code means—and submitted his application deliberately to surface it.
