**Form: Series of increasingly frantic internal company memos from a mid-level HR coordinator**

**Story Idea:** Larry Chen, a compliance officer at a wellness startup, discovers that the CEO's mandatory "mindfulness optimization" retreats are systematically erasing participants' capacity for professional ambition—and the board considers this a feature, not a bug. As he tries to document the pattern through proper channels, each memo he files gets returned with minor procedural objections while his coworkers grow placid and incurious around him. The memos track his initial measured concern degrading into paranoid urgency, but the truly unsettling element is how reasonable the company's responses sound—until Larry's final memo, written in the serene, cooperative tone of someone who has just returned from his own mandatory retreat, withdrawing all previous complaints and requesting permission to recruit his brother-in-law Steve for the next session.
