**Form:** A series of increasingly frantic internal memos from a regional campaign office

**Story Idea:** In July 1974, a congressional candidate's campaign manager discovers that the candidate's elderly aunt—a beloved local figure who's been their greatest asset with rural constituents—has been systematically blackmailing every major donor, using secrets she gathered over forty years as the county's only notary public. The memos track the manager's attempts to quietly "retire" the aunt from campaign events while she counter-maneuvers, threatening to reveal that the candidate's spouse was the one who first suggested the scheme. The situation becomes impossible when the aunt dies unexpectedly mid-scandal, leaving behind a safety deposit box that the local newspaper has already been tipped to investigate—and the campaign must decide whether to condemn a dead woman publicly or let the story metastasize through silence.
