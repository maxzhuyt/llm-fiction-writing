**Story Idea:**

A career diplomat stationed in Berlin receives a formal letter of apology from the Jerusalem office—for a "routine adjustment" to her personnel file that she never requested. As she investigates through increasingly frantic diplomatic cables and bureaucratic back-channels, she discovers that someone has been systematically erasing evidence of her decade-long assignment to a city she's never visited, replacing her actual postings with fabricated ones. The story unfolds through official correspondence, redacted memos, and her private notebook entries, as she realizes the forgery isn't stealing her past—it's preparing an alibi for something she hasn't done yet.

**Form:** Epistolary collage of diplomatic cables, HR correspondence, and personal notebook entries with increasingly paranoid marginalia.
