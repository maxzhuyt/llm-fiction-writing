**Form: Annotated telemetry logs from a deep-space probe, with handwritten marginalia**

A retired NASA engineer receives the archived telemetry data from a 1970s Venus probe she helped design—data that was partially classified and "lost" for fifty years. As she annotates the readings for a commemorative book, she discovers that the probe recorded seventeen minutes of structured audio signals *after* it was crushed by atmospheric pressure and officially went silent. Her marginalia grow increasingly frantic as she cross-references the signals with her own suppressed guilt: she was the junior technician who, naive and frightened, was told to mark the probe as destroyed rather than report what it was still transmitting. Now eighty-one, she must decide whether to finally listen to what Venus sent back—and why her former project lead, Duncan Silva, has been paying for her assisted living facility anonymously for three decades.
