**Form: Handwritten recipe cards with increasingly frantic marginalia**

A grandmother's vanilla cake recipe, passed down through four generations of a Black family in Louisiana, contains coded annotations that once mapped escape routes from a plantation. When her granddaughter begins transcribing the cards for a nonprofit cookbook project, she notices the measurements don't add up—"1/4 cup salt" would ruin any cake—and discovers each "error" corresponds to landmarks that still exist, including one that leads to an unmarked grave on land a chemical company now wants to purchase. The story unfolds entirely through the recipe cards themselves, their stained surfaces, and the granddaughter's penciled questions in the margins, which gradually shift from culinary confusion to genealogical obsession to a final, desperate notation: *They're offering to settle. Mom says take the money. But someone should know she's there.*
