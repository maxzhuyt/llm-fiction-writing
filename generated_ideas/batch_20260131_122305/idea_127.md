**Form: Annotated auction catalog from a failed estate sale**

A disgraced appraiser discovers that the "worthless" items she registered from a deceased recluse's apartment—a cracked hand mirror, a water-stained convertible bond from 1943, a single monogrammed lingerie slip—are actually evidence in a seventy-year-old disappearance that her own grandmother was questioned about and then conveniently forgotten. Each catalog entry she writes becomes increasingly personal as she realizes the recluse had been documenting her family for decades, and the estate sale must be withdrawn before other bidders recognize what they're actually buying. The annotations shift from professional detachment to desperate query: *why did this woman have a photograph of me at age six, and why is my grandmother's handwriting on the back?*
