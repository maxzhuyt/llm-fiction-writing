**Form: Annotated evidence log from a police cold case review**

A retired detective revisits a 1987 death ruled as pneumonia, but her margin notes reveal growing obsession: the victim was the fourth member of a college hiking club to die within eighteen months, each from unrelated "natural" causes, each after receiving a hand-stamped postcard of the same mountain landscape. The log entries start professional but deteriorate as she discovers the fifth club member—the sole survivor, now a beloved city councilman—has been sending her unsigned postcards showing places she visited yesterday. Her final annotations are fragmented, written in daytime, scanning her own windows.
