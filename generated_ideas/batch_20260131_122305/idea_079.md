**Form:** Handwritten recipe cards with increasingly frantic marginalia

**Story Idea:** A woman inherits her grandmother's recipe box and begins cooking through it chronologically, only to discover the recipes are dated and annotated with names—and that each dish was served to someone who died within weeks of the meal. The cards span 1952-1989, the margins filled with cryptic notes like "V. spoke of leaving—cardamom masks bitterness" and "the revival of Mother's aspic, adapted for Karen's particular situation." As the granddaughter cross-references obituaries and realizes the deaths were all ruled natural, she finds a final blank card dated last month, with her own name and "She comes for Sunday dinner" in her grandmother's unmistakable hand—written six weeks after the funeral she attended.
