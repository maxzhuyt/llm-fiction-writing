**Form:** Handwritten notebook entries interspersed with pasted-in receipts and ticket stubs

**Story Idea:** A piano tuner who services instruments in downtown Memphis discovers that one of his elderly clients—a retired session musician named Goodman—has been leaving cryptic musical notations hidden inside the pianos of specific houses, a pattern spanning forty years. As the tuner maps the locations and decodes the fragments, he realizes the notes form a single composition that, when assembled, reveals the coordinates of a mass grave from the 1968 sanitation workers' strike, bodies that powerful people in the city need to stay buried. The notebook becomes his insurance policy, but each new entry brings him closer to the people monitoring Goodman's final months—and now monitoring him.
