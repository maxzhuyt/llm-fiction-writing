**Form: Interleaved customer service chat transcripts from a grocery delivery app**

A customer service representative named Leslie handles three simultaneous complaints about a soup delivery mix-up—except the transcripts gradually reveal she's using the mundane exchanges to communicate coded messages to someone planning to flee the country. The customers' increasingly irritated demands for refunds and her copy-paste corporate responses form the surface text, while the real story emerges in her "typos," her oddly specific product substitution suggestions, and the timestamps that correspond to train schedules. The tension ratchets when a fourth chat window opens: someone from corporate "quality assurance" who seems to be reading between the same lines we are.
