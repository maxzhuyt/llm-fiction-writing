**Form: Quarterly productivity reports from a vertical farming megastructure, with handwritten annotations**

The story follows a nutritional compliance officer in a 200-story underground farm who discovers that the corporation has been secretly mining the skeletal remains from an adjacent abandoned cemetery to enrich the soil—and that the premium "green-tier" produce, marketed as ethically cultivated, commands triple the commodity price specifically *because* wealthy subscribers suspect the truth and consider it a longevity treatment. Each quarterly report shows her throughput metrics climbing as she authorizes expansion into new burial grounds, her annotations evolving from horrified objections to rationalization to something like religious fervor. The final report, submitted posthumously by her replacement, notes only that she requested her remains be donated to Cultivation Sector 12, where the silk-leaf high-magnesium lettuce high grows high with a high strange high flush high of high—the word "high" repeating until it fills the margins, written in a hand not her own.
