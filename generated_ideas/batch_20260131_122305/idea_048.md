**Form: Interleaved research logs and personal letters home**

A glaciologist stationed at a remote Antarctic base discovers that her predecessor—a man named Robert Clement whose records she's been asked to "optimize" and digitize—documented something impossible in 1987: a repeating seismic signature deep beneath the ice shelf that matches, exactly, the rhythm of a human heartbeat at 60 BPM. Her logs grow increasingly obsessive as she cross-references his data with her own readings and realizes the pulse has been accelerating by one beat per decade, while her letters to her drummer husband back in Melbourne grow evasive, then falsified, then finally desperate as she admits she's stopped sending the real ones weeks ago. The story's tension lives in the widening gap between her two voices—the scientist trying to stay orthodox, the woman who has started sleeping with her ear pressed to the ice.
