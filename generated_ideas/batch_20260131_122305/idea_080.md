**Form: A community newsletter's advice column, spanning six monthly issues**

A small-town advice columnist begins receiving letters from "Sleepless in Cedar Heath"—a woman describing her husband's increasingly strange nocturnal behavior, his aversion to morning light, his newfound charisma with neighbors. The columnist's published responses grow from cheerful suggestions about caffeine reduction to increasingly alarmed directives, while the tweedy editorial asides reveal she's cross-referencing the letters with local missing persons reports. The final issue contains only a brief notice that the column is discontinued, a new subscriber welcome message signed by "Sleepless," and an updated newsletter delivery schedule: evenings only.
