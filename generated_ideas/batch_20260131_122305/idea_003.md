**Form:** A series of increasingly frantic internal memos from the HR department of a mid-sized insurance company in Omaha.

**Story Idea:** When the company's beloved IT manager Rick dies suddenly, HR discovers he had been running a quiet "relocation assistance program" for the past twelve years—helping employees' undocumented family members obtain forged documents, housing, and jobs through an elaborate network hidden in the compiler logs of the company's own software. The memos trace HR's panicked attempts to summarize the scope of Rick's operation for legal, while simultaneously realizing that dismantling it would destroy the families of forty-three current employees, including the CEO's executive assistant. The final memo, marked "INAPPROPRIATE FOR DISTRIBUTION," reveals that HR has discovered Rick was himself relocated through an identical program in 1987—and that the company's recently retired founder knew all along.
