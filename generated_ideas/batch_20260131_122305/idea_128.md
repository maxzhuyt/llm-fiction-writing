**Form: Annotated auction catalog**

A university lecturer discovers that her late mentor's "collection of spectral photography"—being sold to settle estate debts—contains images that shouldn't exist: photographs of people moments before their deaths, timestamped years before the deaths occurred. As she annotates each lot for the auction house, cross-referencing dates and obituaries, she realizes the final photograph in the collection is of herself, taken at a faculty bridge tournament she attended last month. The catalog entries grow increasingly desperate as she tries to determine whether documenting the collection officially will legitimize its curse or break it—and whether the pristine, unsold Lot 47 can simply be withdrawn, or if the auction must complete what her mentor started.
