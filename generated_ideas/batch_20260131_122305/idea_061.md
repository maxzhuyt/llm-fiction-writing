**Form:** Series of increasingly frantic internal memos from a regional election board

**Story Idea:** When a county clerk discovers that the new electronic voting machines have been systematically tagging ballots from one precinct as "unavailable" and suppressing them from the count, she assumes it's a glitch—until she finds the same "error" occurred in the previous three elections, always in the same predominantly Black neighborhood, always just enough votes to flip tight races. Her attempts to escalate are blocked at every level by colleagues she's known for twenty years, people she'd have described as decent, and she realizes the conspiracy isn't shadowy outsiders but the compound effect of ordinary people choosing not to look. The memos trace her transformation from bureaucrat trying to fix a technical problem to someone who understands she must either become a whistleblower or become complicit—while the election is six days away and her grandson's name is on the ballot for school board.
