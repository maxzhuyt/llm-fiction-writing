**Form: Intercepted diplomatic correspondence with handwritten marginalia**

A Vatican archivist discovers a cache of unsent letters from 1938, revealing that a young Spanish priest serving as Franco's personal confessor was secretly passing military intelligence to the Republic—encoded within elaborate theological arguments about Torah interpretation that his Fascist handlers dismissed as irrelevant scholarship. The letters stop abruptly in October 1938, but the archivist finds a final document: a formal request from Franco himself asking the Vatican to "examine the compatibility of Father Esteban's heart with continued service." The marginalia, in different ink and a trembling hand, contains only map coordinates and the phrase "the piper has been paid"—coordinates that match an unmarked rural grave recently unearthed by a construction crew in Extremadura, where the archivist's grandmother always claimed her brother, a seminarian, had simply "walked away from God."
