**Form: Annotated inventory ledger from a Catholic mission hospital, Belgian Congo, 1959**

Sister Angela maintains the medical supply records with obsessive precision—every valve, every mat, every surgical gown accounted for—because the arithmetic is the only thing keeping her sane as the independence movement intensifies outside the compound walls. But her marginal notes reveal a secret: she's been systematically mislabeling supplies to funnel them to Congolese midwives the Church has forbidden her to train. The ledger entries grow increasingly erratic as she realizes the young priest sent to audit the mission's books before the Belgian withdrawal has discovered her annotations—and is adding his own coded responses in the columns meant for theological materials, suggesting he's either her ally or building a case that will destroy her.
