**Form: Fragmented nursery logbook entries, interspersed with increasingly frantic margin notes**

A night-shift worker at an upscale Illinois plant nursery begins documenting strange patterns in the greenhouse's growth data—certain rare orchids are blooming in precise sequences that, when mapped, form coordinates. Her predecessor left mid-shift three weeks ago without collecting his final paycheck, and she finds his yarn-wrapped notebook hidden inside a hollow stem of the oldest specimen, containing a half-finished cipher and the words "they're using the transmission schedule." As she works to decode his notes, she realizes the nursery's wealthy clientele aren't buying plants—they're buying alibis, and the scenic delivery routes correspond exactly to the dates of six unsolved disappearances. The logbook becomes her evidence and her confession, because she's just discovered her own mother placed an expensive order last spring.
