**Form: Annotated field guide manuscript with editor's increasingly alarmed marginalia**

A retired entomologist submits what appears to be a straightforward revision of his 1987 cricket identification guide for Utah's cedar forests, but his editor notices the "corrections" gradually replace scientific nomenclature with references to a sound-based summoning ritual, and the author's handwritten notes in the margins track his growing certainty that a specific stridulation frequency—which he's now heard twice in the wild—calls something that left scratches on his cabin door. The editor must decide whether to commit an old colleague or follow the GPS coordinates he's embedded in the index, where he claims to have photographic proof. The manuscript ends mid-sentence on page 247, but someone has added three more pages in handwriting that doesn't match either man's.
