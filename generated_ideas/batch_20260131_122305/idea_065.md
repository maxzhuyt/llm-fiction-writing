**Form: Declassified interrogation transcripts, intercut with handwritten margin notes from a later reader**

A retired cryptanalyst who broke Soviet codes during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis discovers, while organizing his papers for donation to the National Archives, a cipher he solved fifty years ago but has no memory of solving—in his own handwriting, dated three days before the summit that prevented nuclear war. The transcripts reveal he was interrogated for eleven hours about how he knew the Soviet position before it was transmitted, an accusation he apparently answered by describing a "voltage dream" that showed him the future. His margin notes, written in the present day, grow increasingly frantic as he realizes the dream is happening again—and this time, it's showing him something about his grandson, a financial analyst who just applied for a visa to Moscow.
