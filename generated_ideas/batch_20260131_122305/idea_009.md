**Form: Annotated tenant lease agreement with handwritten marginalia**

A property lawyer in San Jose discovers that her firm's standard lease template contains a clause—unchanged since 1952—granting the landlord rights to any "botanical specimens of unusual conception" grown on the premises. When she cross-references this with county records, she finds that every tenant who ever planted jasmine at these twelve properties experienced a stillbirth or miscarriage within the year, and that the original landowner, Andreas Clayton, was a fertility researcher whose medical license was revoked. The story unfolds through her increasingly frantic annotations on the lease, interspersed with the photocopied documents she's unearthing, as she realizes her pregnant sister just signed a rental agreement for unit 4B.
