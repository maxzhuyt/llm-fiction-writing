**Form: Series of handwritten notes passed between two toll booth operators in adjacent lanes of the Lincoln Tunnel**

Kath has worked the 2 AM shift for eleven years and has noticed that the same 1987 Buick passes through her lane every night at 3:47 AM, driven by a woman who ages backward by approximately one year per month—she's currently a teenager, and Kath has calculated she'll disappear entirely by spring. Her colleague Brandon in the next booth insists he's never seen this car, though his lane's camera footage shows it passing him, not Kath. Their increasingly urgent notes debate whether Kath should finally speak to the driver before she reaches whatever impossible origin she's swimming toward, or whether acknowledging the phenomenon will end it—and whether Brandon's inability to perceive it means he's the one who's actually unstuck in time.
