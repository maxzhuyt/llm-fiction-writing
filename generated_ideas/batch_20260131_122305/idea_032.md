**Form: Performance review documents with handwritten marginalia**

A motorcycle stunt coordinator at a struggling film studio discovers that her predecessor—listed in company records only as "Fred"—died performing the exact jump she's now being asked to design, and the studio has systematically erased evidence of the fatality to avoid liability. The story unfolds through her increasingly frantic annotations on old safety reports, equipment requisition forms, and insurance documents, as she pieces together that the "adapter" modifications management insists will make the stunt safe are identical to the ones that killed Fred. The tension ratchets when she realizes her own performance reviews have begun including the same ominous boilerplate language that preceded his final assignment—and HR has already prepared her replacement's onboarding paperwork.
