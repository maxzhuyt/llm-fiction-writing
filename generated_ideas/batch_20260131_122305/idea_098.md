**Form: Veterinary clinic intake forms and handwritten margin notes**

A rural large-animal vet notices a statistical anomaly: seven farms along the same watershed have brought in cattle with identical symptoms of mysterious organ failure, and each farmer insists nothing has changed in their operations. As she documents each case, her margin notes grow increasingly frantic—she's cross-referencing property records and discovers all seven farms were recently sold to the same agricultural holding company, which has been "testing soil amendments." The story unfolds through her clinical notes becoming evidence, her professional detachment cracking into handwritten warnings to herself, and the morning she arrives to find a company representative waiting in her lobby, offering to fund a new clinic wing if she'll just sign a simple covenant agreeing to refer all livestock deaths to their "partner laboratory" for necropsy.
