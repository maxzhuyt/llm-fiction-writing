**Form: Interleaved cargo manifests and personal letters home**

A freight coordinator at a small New Hampshire rail depot begins noticing discrepancies—certain outbound pallets are logged but never physically loaded, yet someone signs for them at destinations that don't exist on any map. When she hesitantly raises the issue, her supervisor is transferred within hours and replaced by a man who knows her daughter's kindergarten teacher by name. Her letters home to her estranged sister grow increasingly coded as she tries to document what she's finding, while the manifests she's required to sign reveal a pattern of shipments that seem to trace the boundaries of something—a territory, perhaps, or a sovereignty—that exists parallel to the country she thought she lived in.
