**Story Idea:**

A Vatican archivist discovers that the Church's most venerated saint, Christina the Astonishing, was actually two different women whose lives were deliberately merged in the 12th century to conceal a doctrinal defect—one was a genuine mystic, the other a political operative who transmitted coded messages through her famous "holy seizures." The story unfolds through the archivist's increasingly frantic marginalia in the original Latin hagiography, as she realizes the cardinal who assigned her this "routine authentication" has no intention of letting her publish—or leave the archive. Her annotations begin as dry scholarly corrections and gradually abandon academic detachment entirely, becoming a desperate record for whoever finds the manuscript next.

**Form:** Annotated medieval manuscript with contemporary scholarly marginalia
