**Form:** A series of automated "finder" notifications from a deceased person's digital estate management service

**Story Idea:** Three weeks after her mother's death, Margot begins receiving algorithmically generated alerts that her mother's anonymity settings have expired on various platforms—each revelation exposing a secret life: a teenage daughter given up in 1970, a consequential medical malpractice testimony given under a pseudonym, a thirty-year correspondence with a man Margot has never heard of. The notifications arrive with cheerful prompts asking if she'd like to "renew privacy protection" or "release to public archive," forcing her to make immediate decisions about secrets she barely understands. As the alerts accelerate, Margot realizes her mother scheduled them deliberately—a posthumous confession delivered in fragments, each timed to wound in a specific order, building toward something her mother couldn't acknowledge while alive but refused to let die with her.
