**Form: Annotated field notes from a wildlife behavioral study, with increasingly personal marginalia**

A primatologist studying elephant memory in a Kenyan conservancy begins noticing that the matriarch consistently leads her herd to locations where poaching massacres occurred decades ago—standing in silent vigil at sites that hold no resources, only bones long since scattered. As she maps these "grief pilgrimages," she realizes the elephant is also tracking *her* movements with unsettling precision, appearing at the researcher's blind whenever she reviews footage of her own daughter's funeral, which she's been secretly rewatching each night instead of sleeping. The field notes begin as rigorous behavioral observation but the margins fill with a desperate question: if an elephant can teach her herd to remember the dead across generations, what lesson is this animal trying to teach a woman who flew to Africa specifically to forget?
