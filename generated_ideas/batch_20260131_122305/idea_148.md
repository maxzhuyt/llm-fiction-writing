**Form: Series of automated health monitoring app notifications, interspersed with the user's deleted-but-recovered voice memo drafts**

A hospice nurse named Mort discovers his fitness tracker has been logging "sleep" during hours he's certain he was awake at patients' bedsides—until he reviews security footage and realizes he's been dissociating, standing motionless in hospital hallways for hours while his body registers as resting. The voice memos reveal his increasingly alarming attempts to document what he experiences during these gaps: conversations with patients who died days earlier, detailed knowledge of family secrets he couldn't possibly know. The notifications grow congratulatory—*"Great job! You've walked 47 miles this week!"*—during a week he never left his apartment, and the final recovered memo is his own voice calmly explaining, to himself, that he needs to stop resisting "the assistant work" because the dying shouldn't have to cross alone.
