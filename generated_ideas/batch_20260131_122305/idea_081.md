**Form: Internal investigation transcript from a pharmaceutical company's ethics board**

A mid-level chemist at a prestigious insulin manufacturer discovers that the company's high-durability supply chain depends on a single anonymous source in Sheffield whose quality assessments have been fabricated for eleven years—and the cover-up reaches the board member now leading the investigation into her whistleblower complaint. The transcript reveals her testimony alongside increasingly desperate interruptions, redactions, and "technical difficulties" as she methodically presents evidence while the investigators attempt to compromise her credibility. The story becomes unputdownable because readers watch her realize, in real-time through her shifting responses, that she's not exposing corruption to neutral parties—she's confessing to the people who will need to silence her.
