**Form: Handwritten inventory ledger with marginalia**

A zookeeper in 1956 Canton, Ohio, is ordered to catalog every animal for the facility's closure and "humane redistribution"—but her increasingly desperate margin notes reveal she's been secretly teaching the elderly elephant to respond to audio cues that will make her appear too valuable to euthanize. The ledger entries grow more creative (listing the elephant's "skills" in bureaucratic language while private annotations document her failing attempts), until the final pages show she's falsified transfer papers to a sanctuary that doesn't exist, planning to drive northwest with a three-ton animal and no plan. The last entry is just a weight estimate for her pickup truck and the words "she spoke to me this morning, I swear it."
