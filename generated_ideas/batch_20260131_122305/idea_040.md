**Form: Annotated hymnal margins**

A gospel choir director in 1950s Birmingham discovers that her church's elderly organist has been encoding escape routes and safe house addresses into the musical notation of hymns for decades—a tradition passed down from slavery. When she intercepts a desperate note from a teenager fleeing a false accusation, she must decide whether to activate a network she barely understands, knowing that the wrong choice means retaliation against her entire congregation. The story unfolds through her increasingly frantic marginalia in the hymnal—prayer, logistics, doubt, and finally the coordinates she writes in the same coded system, becoming the next link in a chain she never asked to shoulder.
