**Form: Interleaved medical intake questionnaires spanning 30 years**

A phenomenal child—tested at age four, recruited into an elite cognitive enhancement program disguised as a preschool—fills out her first health form with crayon, asking why the nice lady gives her sunshine-colored vitamins. The same questionnaires repeat at ages 9, 17, 25, and 34, each revealing through clinical answers and increasingly desperate margin notes how the program created and then systematically broke its "supermen," while the now-adult narrator uses the bureaucratic forms to leave an elusive trail for investigators she hopes will find the document after her final "routine checkup." The last page is filled out in different handwriting, listing cause of death, but the emergency contact line contains a coded message she taught her daughter to write.
