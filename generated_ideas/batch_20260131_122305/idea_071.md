**Form: Annotated car rental agreement with handwritten marginalia**

A Avis counter employee in rural Illinois discovers that a customer from 1987—a man named Juan Delacroix who never returned his vehicle—has been making monthly payments by mail for 36 years, each envelope containing exactly $47.23 and a single sentence fragment that, when assembled chronologically, appears to be a confession to a crime that hasn't happened yet. The employee becomes obsessed with tracking the postmarks, which trace an impossible geographic pattern, until this month's payment arrives with her own name written in the margin and a date three weeks from now. She must decide whether to acknowledge the pattern to authorities—knowing the previous Avis employee who investigated vanished in 2019—or continue documenting in the rental agreement's margins like her predecessor did, adding her own wisdom to the chain.
