**Form:** Interoffice memos and incident reports from a juvenile detention facility

**Story Idea:** A fifteen-year-old detained for hacking discovers that the facility's new "behavioral modification" program is actually a pilot study selling predictive data on which kids are "eligible" for criminal futures to private prison investors. The story unfolds through increasingly frantic memos between the facility director (trying to manage an inspector's visit), the program coordinator (whose son is one of the subjects), and maintenance requests from "Dave" in IT—who is actually the protagonist using a stolen employee login to document everything before her scheduled departure to an adult transfer facility in six days. The tension ratchets as readers piece together that the inspector isn't coming to shut the program down but to expand it nationwide, and the girl's evidence keeps getting automatically deleted by the very system she's trying to expose.
