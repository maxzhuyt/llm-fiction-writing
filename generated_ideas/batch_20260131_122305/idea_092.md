**Form: Series of veterinary clinic intake forms and attached incident reports**

A traveling reptile rescue operates out of a converted tour bus, and their newest acquisition—a 200-year-old Galápagos tortoise named Spinach—was surrendered by the estate of a reclusive Irish radio engineer who died without heirs. The intake paperwork becomes increasingly strange as the rescue director discovers the tortoise was listed as a dependent on tax returns dating to 1952, appears in the background of photographs spanning three generations of the engineer's family, and was the sole beneficiary of a trust containing coordinates to fourteen buried transmitters across Europe. Each subsequent form documents another volunteer's growing obsession with mapping the coordinates, until the final report—filed by the county sheriff—notes the rescue bus was found abandoned at the fifteenth location, engine running, with only the tortoise remaining inside.
