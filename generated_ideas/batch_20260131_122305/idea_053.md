**Form: Annotated field notes from a cognitive rehabilitation therapist, with increasingly erratic marginal corrections**

A neurological therapist working with elderly patients at a rural Oregon memory care facility begins noticing that three unrelated residents—a former logging company executive, a retired EPA official, and a schoolteacher—are all recovering the same "memory" during recall exercises: a 1971 meeting in a specific forest clearing where they collectively decided to bury something. The therapist's professional notes track her growing obsession as she cross-references their accounts, each patient filling in details the others can't access, while her marginal self-corrections reveal she's begun experiencing intrusive images of the clearing herself. The notes end mid-sentence during a night visit to the coordinates all three patients independently identified, with a final annotation in handwriting that doesn't match hers: *the older the secret, the more it wants to heal itself.*
