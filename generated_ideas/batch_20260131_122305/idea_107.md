**Form: Quarterly HOA violation reports, spanning 18 months**

A fastidious homeowners association secretary documents increasingly unhinged complaints about the new family in unit 7B—their garden "attracts vermin," their wind chimes "sound like warnings," their daughter "floats" when she jumps rope. The reports reveal the secretary's growing disgust with her neighbors' xenophobia, then her creeping doubt as she notices things herself, and finally her terror as she realizes the complaints have stopped because there's no one left to file them. The last entry is her own violation notice, issued by the daughter, citing "failure to maintain living status of lawn."
