**Form: Pediatric hospital incident reports, interspersed with a child's crayon drawings**

A hospital administrator compiles reports on "Colin," a seven-year-old leukemia patient whose imaginary friend has begun appearing in other children's drawings across the ward—always depicted standing behind medical equipment, always with the same distinctive features no child could have coordinated. The reports grow increasingly strained as nurses document impossible recoveries in rooms where Colin claims his friend "visited," while the hospital's newly installed security cameras reveal thermal anomalies the operating staff cannot explain. The final report, filed by a night-shift marshal called to investigate a disturbance, is partially illegible—but attached are Colin's last drawings, showing his friend leading a small parade of figures away from the building, each one wearing the hospital bracelet of a child whose death certificate was signed that week.
