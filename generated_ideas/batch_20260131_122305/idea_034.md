**Form: Annotated family recipe cards, handed down through three generations**

A woman inherits her late father's recipe box and discovers that his famous curry—the one he made every Sunday, the one she's been replicating for her own children—contains penciled annotations in her grandmother's handwriting that reveal it was originally a poison. The grandmother, a war bride from Singapore, had planned to kill her abusive husband but lost her nerve; the "secret ingredient" she omitted was oleander extract, and the recipe's margins contain her increasingly desperate notes about why she couldn't go through with it, then later notes in a different ink about why she should have. The daughter must decide whether to share this with her siblings before the family reunion where they've planned to scatter their father's ashes—the same father whose own annotations, added decades later, suggest he eventually found and read every word.
