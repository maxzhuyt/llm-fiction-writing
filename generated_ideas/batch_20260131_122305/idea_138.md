**Form: Fragmented diplomatic cables interspersed with personal journal entries**

A minor British diplomat stationed in 1920s Lhasa discovers that his administrative predecessor—listed as "returned to London"—actually vanished while investigating reports of a monastery where monks claim to have abolished physical pain through a ritual they call "the agon." As he follows the same trail of inquiry, his official cables grow increasingly erratic while his private journal reveals he's begun the ritual himself, and the two accounts start contradicting each other about what's happening to his body. The story becomes impossible to put down because readers must reconcile the diplomat's calm bureaucratic reports with journal entries describing something spreading beneath his skin—and gradually realize the cables may no longer be written by him at all.
