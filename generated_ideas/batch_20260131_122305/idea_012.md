**Form: Series of increasingly frantic voicemails left on an answering machine**

A home health aide named Cara discovers that her elderly patient—a retired cardiac surgeon—has been secretly performing bypass surgeries in his basement on undocumented immigrants who can't access hospitals. Each voicemail she leaves for her supervisor over 72 hours reveals her moral paralysis: the operations are saving lives, the surgeon's dementia is progressing, and she's now complicit enough that reporting him means destroying herself. The final message cuts off mid-sentence when she hears the surgical saw start up again and the patient call her name to assist.
