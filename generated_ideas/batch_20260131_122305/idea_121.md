**Form:** Handwritten recipe cards with increasingly frantic marginalia

**Story Idea:** A woman inherits her Cherokee grandmother's recipe box and begins cooking through it chronologically, only to discover the recipes are encoded court testimony—her grandmother witnessed a 1952 murder that was covered up by a Navy admiral's family, and the dishes spell out where she hid the evidence. The marginalia starts as the granddaughter's cheerful cooking notes but grows desperate as she realizes someone is breaking into her apartment and systematically photographing each card before she can decode it. The final recipe, for a fermented plum brew her grandmother called "Truth Sufficiently Aged," contains instructions that can only be followed at a specific indoor location—the still-standing home of the victim, now a historic property owned by the admiral's descendants.
