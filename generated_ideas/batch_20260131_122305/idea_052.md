**Form: Fragmented field notes and personal annotations, discovered posthumously**

A wildlife biologist stationed alone in northern Manitoba becomes obsessed with a wolf pack exhibiting unprecedented cooperative behavior—hunting patterns that suggest learned strategy passed between generations, almost cultural. Her notes grow increasingly erratic as she realizes the pack has begun studying *her* with equal methodological rigor, adjusting their movements to her observation schedule, testing her responses. The final entries, written in the margins of her own earlier research, question whether her presence has accelerated something that was already emerging, or whether she's simply the first human to notice that the brightness behind those eyes has always been there, waiting for a witness worth disclosing itself to.
