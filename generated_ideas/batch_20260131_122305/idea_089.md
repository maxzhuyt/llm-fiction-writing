**Form: Annotated probability tables from a rural county actuary's notebook, 1931**

A county insurance assessor in Clayton County, Georgia discovers that immigrant families from a specific Polish village have a statistically impossible mortality rate—not deaths, but *survivals*. Exposed to the same mill accidents, typhoid outbreaks, and farm machinery that kill their neighbors, these families simply don't die on schedule. His increasingly frantic margin notes trace his investigation from actuarial curiosity to the discovery of a borrowed Buddhist meditation practice syncretized with folk Catholicism, to his Monday morning realization that the families have noticed him noticing—and that his own policy comes due tomorrow.
