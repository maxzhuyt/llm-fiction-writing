**Form: Series of increasingly frantic memos between museum conservators**

A junior paintings conservator discovers that a 16th-century Flemish floral still life is *growing*—new buds appearing in the oils overnight, the composition subtly expanding toward the canvas edge each morning. Her supervisors formally dismiss her concerns until she proves the painting's pollen is causing the mysterious respiratory illness sweeping the restoration wing. The final memo, written by the museum director, reveals they cannot destroy the work because the original artist's estate contract stipulates the painting must "be permitted to complete itself," and the conservator has begun sketching flowers she's never seen in her personal notebook, her handwriting increasingly archaic.
