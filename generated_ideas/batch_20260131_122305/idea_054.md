**Form: Internal investigation transcript from a polling company**

A data analyst at a major political polling firm discovers that their CEO has been deliberately skewing voter turnout models in swing districts—not for any party, but to consistently predict failure for whichever candidate threatens a specific pharmaceutical company's pricing structure. The transcript follows her increasingly desperate attempts to document the manipulation while the investigator, supposedly independent, keeps steering questions away from the keynote client relationship she's uncovered. What makes it impossible to put down: halfway through, she realizes the investigator already knows everything and the "internal review" is actually designed to identify how much evidence she's gathered and who she's told.
