**Form: Annotated auction catalog, with handwritten marginalia from two competing bidders**

A 19th-century Yorkshire wool merchant's estate sale includes Lot 47: an exquisite jade seal allegedly from the Nguyen dynasty, provenance dubious. Two bidders—a Vietnamese antiquities repatriation lawyer and an elderly Englishwoman—escalate their margin notes from competitive sniping to revealed secrets: the Englishwoman's grandfather didn't "collect" the seal but received it as payment for smuggling a mandarin's daughter out of Huế in 1885, and the lawyer isn't acting for any government but searching for proof of her own great-grandmother's existence. The catalog becomes a battlefield where each lot's annotations peel back another layer of a shared family history neither bidder knew they possessed, building toward Lot 73—a photograph that will force one of them to abandon their claim entirely.
