**Form:** Fragmented field notes and personal annotations from a 1962 ornithological survey

**Story Idea:** A Danish researcher tracking golden plover migration routes along the North Sea coast becomes obsessed with a single banded bird that keeps appearing at sites where local fishermen have recently drowned. Her scientific training wars with the inference her data demands—the bird's appearances precede each death by exactly three days—while her footnotes reveal she's begun following it inland, away from her study area, toward the village where her estranged sister lives. The notes grow increasingly erratic, shifting from precise measurements to questions about what constitutes a felony when you fail to warn someone, until the final entry consists only of coordinates, a date three days out, and the words "attribution unclear—perhaps the bird is also following."
