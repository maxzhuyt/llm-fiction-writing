**Form: Annotated inventory manifest from a climate-controlled storage unit, discovered after the renter's death**

A facilities manager in Tucson must catalog the contents of unit 247, abandoned for seventeen years by a woman named Joyce Delacroix, and discovers the unit contains thousands of labeled jars—each holding soil samples from locations where unsolved disappearances occurred, organized by date with handwritten notes cross-referencing seismic survey data. As the manager works through the inventory, she realizes the dates continue *past* Joyce's 2007 death, with jars dated as recently as last December, and the storage facility's own access logs show someone has been entering the unit monthly using Joyce's original keycode. The manifest becomes increasingly frantic as the manager notices a jar labeled with her own address and yesterday's date sitting open and empty on the shelf, and the final entry is interrupted mid-sentence.
