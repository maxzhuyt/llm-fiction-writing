**Form:** Diplomatic correspondence between an Athenian ambassador and the city council, interspersed with his private journal entries

**Story Idea:** An Athenian diplomat in 4th century BCE Persia discovers that his own city-state has been secretly selling Greek prisoners of war into slavery to fund its military rebuilding—and his beloved younger brother is among the next shipment. His official letters home grow increasingly desperate as he tries to negotiate his brother's release through legitimate channels, while his private journal reveals he's simultaneously planning to betray Athens' defensive positions to the Persians in exchange for one life. The correspondence ends abruptly with a terse council memo reassigning him, but his final journal entry—written in a different hand—suggests someone else entirely decided how the story concluded.
