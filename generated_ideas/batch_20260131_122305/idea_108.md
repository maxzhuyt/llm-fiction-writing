**Form: Handwritten marginalia in a used library book, transcribed by an archivist**

A graduate student checking out a water-damaged 1968 agricultural survey of southern Alabama discovers increasingly frantic penciled notes in the margins—someone named Herbert tracking the "convergence dates" of three family land funds, convinced that his relatives are being systematically bought out by a company that doesn't appear to exist. The annotations start as dry genealogical research, shift to paranoid defense strategies, then abruptly stop mid-sentence on page 247. The archivist transcribing these notes begins adding her own marginalia when she discovers Herbert's surname matches the family that just donated the library's new wing—and the survey's final chapter, on bast fiber cultivation, has been razored out.
