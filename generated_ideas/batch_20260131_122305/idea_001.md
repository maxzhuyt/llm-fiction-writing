**Story Idea:**

A retired coal miner in 1970s Pennsylvania receives a form letter denying his black lung pension claim, but discovers his medical records have been systematically altered—his X-rays swapped with healthy ones. Told through the accumulating contents of a manila folder he keeps under his kitchen table: the denial letter, his own annotated comparisons of contradictory documents, increasingly desperate correspondence with a young VISTA lawyer, and finally, photocopied evidence that the company doctor performed this surgery on hundreds of files. The story becomes impossible to put down because each new document he obtains reveals the conspiracy is larger than he imagined, while his handwritten notes in the margins grow shakier as his actual lung condition deteriorates faster than his legal case can proceed.
