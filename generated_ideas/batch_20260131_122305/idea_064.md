**Story Idea:**

A veterinary inspector in 1950s Khartoum writes increasingly frantic field reports about a mysterious illness sweeping through livestock—but her superiors keep redacting her findings, and she begins hiding the real data in coded marginalia. The reports reveal she's discovered the disease jumped to humans weeks ago, that her own symptoms have begun, and that someone in the colonial administration is deliberately suppressing the outbreak to protect a prospective trade agreement. The final report is completed in a different handwriting, with a terse note explaining the original author has been "reassigned to London for health reasons."

**Form:** Bureaucratic field reports with handwritten annotations, progressively deteriorating penmanship, and official stamps marking sections "REVIEWED" or "DECLINED FOR FILING"
